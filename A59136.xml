            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to theſe ſenſeleſs Stocks their <hi>Druid's,</hi> or <hi>Magi</hi> (whom they accounted their Wiſe Men, and ſerved in ſtead of <hi>Flamins</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi>) compelled them to pay their <hi>Adoration;</hi> Worſhiping in <hi>Groves,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting <hi>Fortified Woods</hi> their <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They wore about their Middles Iron Chains, and to them, both Men and Women had ſhort Swords girded; bearing in their Hands a Spear with a Braſs Knob or Bell at the end of it, to make a greate noiſe of Terrour in Combates; the Women uſually going to War with them, and not only Fighting Couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their Husbands ſides, Animating them by their Courage, but often Commanding <hi>Battalions</hi> and <hi>Armys,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> too fatally found, when they ſtrugled, with much Slaughter, 123 Years for this <hi>Iſland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> appear by all Authors to have been very ſparing in their Diet; and not much given to Venery: Though they had many Wives in Common, amongſt Brothers and Kindred, yet the Children redounded to his credit who firſt Cropt the Mothers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61951:7"/> Virgin Roſe. And by this means, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> (a very judicious Author) affirms, they were of ſo Healthful and Lively a Conſtitution, That many, if not moſt, in the warm <hi>Southern</hi> parts, according to the Term of a <hi>Natural Life,</hi> exceeded 130 Years. Yet they much delighted in Ornaments, as <hi>Bracelets, Beads, Iron Rings, &amp;c.</hi> And preferred their <hi>Paint'd</hi> and <hi>Carv'd Skins</hi> before the moſt gaudy Cloathing.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Agriculture</hi> was but little, though the Earth much invited them to it, by its promiſing Fruitfulneſs. They had not the uſe of Ploughs, and only Sowed their Grain on the Melloweſt Land after Rain; then laying great weights on bundles of Buſhes drag it over, in the nature of Harrowing. Yet they had found out the way of making their Drink with ſodden Barly, which (though perhaps in a higher Improvement) continues to this day, to the great Advantage and Health of the Moderate People of the Nation. As for the fleſh of <hi>Fowl</hi> and <hi>Wild Creatures,</hi> they declin'd it; as they did likewiſe <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Milk.</hi> Then <hi>Hares</hi> were found in ſuch abundance, That they Flock'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like <hi>Sheep,</hi> fearleſs of the <hi>Hunter</hi> or his <hi>Hounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Opinions in <hi>Theology</hi> were, <hi>That the Souls of Men Dyed not, but (according to</hi> Pythagoras) <hi>had a Tranſmigration from one Body to another.</hi> And on their Solemn Days their <hi>Druid's</hi> and <hi>Bards</hi> Sung the Praiſes of Renowned <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſuch as had <hi>Dyed in War, or been Famous for any Rare Invention;</hi> and this they did to Incourage and ſtir up others to Imitation.</p>

He held a free correſpondence with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and was much Honoured by them; their Kings ſending him divers Rich Preſents, as alſo Artificers to aſſiſt him in Building or Enlarging <hi>Troy Novant,</hi> or <hi>New Troy,</hi> which he afterward called by his own Name, <hi>Care Lud,</hi> or <hi>Lud Town,</hi> now the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which then reached no further than <hi>Dowgate</hi> Eaſtward; the Houſes ſtanding up and down Angular, and not Regular in Streets: Yet he Incloſed it with a good Wall, defended by Bullwarks, and on it many Watch-Towers, calling its Weſtern Gate <hi>Lud</hi>'s <hi>Gate,</hi> which Name it retaines to this day,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61951:10"/> placing his own Effigies, in Marble, on the Inſide of it. At his Death he Recommended his two Sons, <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> and <hi>Temantius</hi> (being very Young) to the care of <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> his Brother, who held his Regal Seat at <hi>Verulam,</hi> now called <hi>St. Albanes,</hi> in <hi>Hartford-ſhire.</hi> Upon the Death of King <hi>Lud</hi> the People came and offered the Principality to him, and the Heirs of his Body, by conſent of the Three Eſtates of the <hi>Trino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants, viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Eſſex, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Hartford-ſhire.</hi> But in conſideration of his Truſt, and his <hi>Nephews</hi> Rights, he contented himſelf with only a Part, for when they came to Age, he placed <hi>Andrageus</hi> in <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novant,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> joyning to it all <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Dukedom of <hi>Kent,</hi> which in that time he had Conquered, bringing the <hi>Canti</hi> under his Subjection.

This <hi>Emperour</hi> was called <hi>the Patron of Virtue,</hi> from the gifts and rewards he diſtributed among pious and learned Men. In his time the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> flouriſhed, and many places of Publick Worſhip were errected in <hi>Britain.</hi> He began his Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 139, and Reigned 23 Years.</p>

                  <hi>Commodus,</hi> though of a very wicked Life, was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, moved at the Sufferings of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the <hi>Perſecution.</hi> In his time flouriſhed King <hi>Lucius,</hi> a <hi>Britain,</hi> Son to King <hi>Coillus,</hi> who Built <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and great Grandſon to King <hi>Arviragus,</hi> who Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Emperour <hi>Druſius</hi>'s Daughter. He (to the honour of this Nation) was the firſt <hi>King</hi> in the World that embraced <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and by it ſet a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others; and to be the better informed in ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61951:18"/> Sacred a matter, he ſent <hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medvinus,</hi> two of his Learned Counſellors, to <hi>Elutherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to commune with him, and receive Inſtructions from him for the good Government of his Kingdom: The good Biſhop at this greatly rejoyced, and not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them in the <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> but ſent <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> to the King with the following Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good King, you have received (as I underſtand by your Meſſengers, to my great Rejoycing) in the Kingdom of</hi> Britain, <hi>by Gods Mercy, both the</hi> Law <hi>and the</hi> Faith <hi>of</hi> Chriſt Jeſus <hi>our ever Bleſſed Lord; you have both the</hi> Old <hi>and</hi> New Teſtament; <hi>out of the ſame, through Gods Grace, by the Advice of your Realm, take a Law; and by the ſame, through Gods ſufferance, Rule you your Kigndom of</hi> Britain; <hi>for in that Kingdom you are Gods Vicar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we ſee what different Spirits the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were of <hi>in the time of Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> to what they have ſince been; they were then too Modeſt to Uſurp Authority out of their own Juriſdiction, and claim <hi>Supremacy over Kings;</hi> yet <hi>Luxury, Pride</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> has ſince brought them not only to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious height of Arrogancy to ſet the World in a Flame with Wars and Miſchiefs, but even to dare to Corrupt the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and by bringing in <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own,</hi> joſtle out <hi>the Doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles,</hi> filling the Nations with <hi>Blood,</hi> and laying them Diſolate, where they have been oppoſed, or their Revenge could take place.</p>
               <p>The King, upon this Advice, called a Council, and changed the Seats of the three <hi>Arch Flammins,</hi> or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prieſts, into <hi>Arch Biſhopricks, Viz.</hi> at <hi>London, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> and the 24 Subordinate <hi>Flammins</hi> into ſo many <hi>Biſhops Sees.</hi> The Idol Gods of the <hi>Britains</hi> were laid in the Duſt, who were many, <hi>viz. Taramis,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter; Tutates,</hi> or <hi>Mercury; Helus,</hi> or <hi>Mars; Hues,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61951:19"/> or <hi>Bacchus; Belenus,</hi> or <hi>Apollo; Beliſama,</hi> or the <hi>Moon; Owvana,</hi> or <hi>Minerva; Adreſte,</hi> or <hi>Venus, Victrix</hi> of the <hi>Romans, Ceres, Proſerpina,</hi> and other <hi>Infernal Deities,</hi> to whom they made Nightly Sacrifice, ſo that now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches and Temples were Built in moſt Cities, Religion and Arts flouriſhed, and the Nation had a proſpect of Peace and Happineſs, after many Miſeries and Toils of War. This <hi>Commodus</hi> began his Reign 182, and Reigned 13 Years; the <hi>Britains</hi> living peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably under him. To him Succeeded</p>

                  <hi>Didus Julianus.</hi> In this Emperours Reign little can be expected; he began it <hi>Anno.</hi> 194, and Reigned only two Months. <hi>Julius Severius</hi> his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> keeping things quiet in his time.

                  <hi>Septimus Severus</hi> Reigned next.

                  <hi>Baſſianus Caracalla</hi> was Proclaimed <hi>Co-Emperour</hi> with his Brother <hi>Geta,</hi> but he quickly Slew him, and took the Government upon himſelf: He had no War with <hi>Britain,</hi> but liv'd a Lewd Life, lying with his Mother-in-Law, being very Proud and Cruel to his Subjects during his Reign, which began <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 218; and laſted ſix Years.</p>

                  <hi>Heliogabilus,</hi> or <hi>The Prieſt of the Sun,</hi> being taken from his Prieſtly Office, and Crowned Emperour, became ſo Debauch'd, and great a Glutton, that he was abhor'd of all Men; his wiſhes were, <hi>That his Neck might be as long as a</hi> Crane's, <hi>that he might the longer taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Food in its paſſage to his Stomach;</hi> and <hi>That the whole People of</hi> Rome <hi>had but one Neck, ſo that he might gain him a laſting Memory by ſtriking it off:</hi> He lay with his own <hi>Mother,</hi> and divers of his near <hi>Kinſwomen;</hi> ſo that his not minding Publick Affairs, gave the <hi>Britains</hi> Peace, and Religion time to Encreaſe and flouriſh.

In his time Armies of Footmen and Horſemen were ſeen in the Air over <hi>London</hi> and divers other places, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; together with great Blaſts, Thunders and Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, followed by mighty Storms of Hail and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, that did much Dammage.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gordianus</hi> Reigned but Forty Days, and had no War with <hi>Britain.</hi> Yet in his time the <hi>Iceni</hi> and <hi>Coritani</hi> Warred on each other about ſetling the Boundaries of

At his coming to the Throne, it Rained Blood in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of this Kingdom, and a Terrible Bloody Sword was ſeen in the Air for Three Nights, a little after Sunſet.

                     <hi>Oſwick</hi> having made his way to the Throne, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 718, laboured to ſettle himſelf in the Affections and good liking of the People, by giving large Gifts to the Nobles, and in diſtributing <hi>Corn</hi> to the Poor out of his <hi>Granaries,</hi> in his Second Year when a great Scarcity happened; ſo that in his Eleven Years Reign, he kept his People quiet at home, and for the moſt part free from Wars abroad.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61951:50"/> him the Habit of a <hi>Monk;</hi> where in a little <hi>Monaſtery</hi> he had cauſed to be Built, he ſpent the remainder of his Days.

                     <hi>Alfwald,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> took the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon him, putting ſome of the Uſurpers to Death, and Baniſhed others; but he was Murthered by the Conſpiracy of one <hi>Siga,</hi> when he had Reigned Eleven Years. During theſe Diſturbances and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Kings, many terrible Sights appeared in the Air, hollow Groanings, and, as it were, Laments, were heard in the Earth, in divers places; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting Apparitions of <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Spectrums</hi> Haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pallaces and Houſes of Noblemen and others.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the Eighth King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> finding he was too weak to oppoſe the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> who had got ſtrong footing in the <hi>Northern</hi> Frontier Towns, he made a League with <hi>Penda</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> at which <hi>Oſwye</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> being much diſguſted, raiſed a great Army; and War being denounced, the <hi>Eaſt Angles</hi> and <hi>Mercians</hi> thinking it not convenient to ſtay his coming, reſolved to place the ſeat of War in his Country; but in their March, a fatal Omen ſeemed to forbid it, <hi>viz. Two Flights of Birds, (one from the</hi> North, <hi>and the other from the</hi> South) <hi>met, and Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered over their Hoſt with ſuch Fury, that many drops of Blood, as it had been ſmall ſprinklings of Raine, fell from the Wounds made on each other with their Bills and Talons, till at laſt the</hi> Southern <hi>Flight turned Taile, with a ſtrange Noiſe, or Cryes, and were Purſued till out of ſight.</hi> Soon after this, <hi>Penda, Ethelbert,</hi> and their <hi>Confederates,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battel with <hi>Oſwye</hi> near <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and in a great Overthrow of their Armys, the two <hi>Kings</hi> were Slain with 18000 of their Men, and among them 30 Dukes and chief Leaders.

He purchas'd his Peace with a great Sum, when he found he was too feeble to oppoſe his Enemies; and gave up <hi>Cantionary Towns</hi> to the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> for the ſecurity of payment: This cauſed a Murmuring among his Subjects, which broke into Tumults; ſo that much grieved at his misfortunes Abroad and at Home, he Dyed, when he had Reigned Eight Years.</p>

In his time a terrible <hi>Earth-Quake happened, giving three violent ſhocks, which ſhattered and overturned divers maſſy Buildings; but the greateſt dammage fell upon the City of</hi> London, <hi>many People being deſtroyed by the fall of Chimneys, Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. And ſoon after <hi>ſo great a</hi> Froſt <hi>happened, That loaded Carts went over the principal Rivers, as ſecurely as if it had been on dry Land.</hi>

The <hi>Danes</hi> in his time began to be troubleſome, and Invaded the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Callidonians,</hi> commiting terrible Outrages in <hi>Argyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and other parts, ſubduing all the <hi>Iſlands</hi> belonging to <hi>Scotland,</hi> advancing after many Battels, upon the <hi>Picts,</hi> and as far as the <hi>Tweed;</hi> whereupon thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions craved Aid of this, and other <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, to Expel them; urging, as a main reaſon, the Mutual Danger they were in, by the Invaſion of ſo powerful an Enemy; which (though it proved fatally true) was at that time little minded. This King Reigned Seven Years.</p>

                     <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the Thirteenth King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 714. In his Second Year, on Midſummer-Day at Sunſeting, <hi>dark Clouds overſpread the Skies, and then withdrawing, the Element ſeemed on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61951:58"/> Fire; after that, many fearful ſights appeared in the Air, of</hi> Armies <hi>and</hi> Monſterous Creatures; upon which followed ſo great a <hi>Storm, that many Ships were broken to pieces in the Havens, mighty Oaks rent up, and Houſes overturned.</hi> He Reigned, ſometimes in War and at others in Peace, Thirty Five Years.</p>

                     <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the Second of that Name, and the Fourteenth King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 749. He, in the laſt Year of his Reign, ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> to treat of Peace, and the reſtoring ſome Towns taken from him and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, which <hi>Offa</hi> ſeemed enclinable to hearken to, ſending them back with Preſents and Rewards, as alſo a diſſembling Letter to Invite <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to his <hi>Court,</hi> under pretence of giving him his Beauteous Daughter <hi>Alfrida</hi> in Marriage, that the League between them might be the ſtronger; but indeed aiming to add the <hi>Eaſt Angle</hi> Kingdom to his own Dominions; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten the too credulous Prince in his power, he conſulted with <hi>Quindride</hi> how he ſhould diſpoſe of him, to accompliſh his deſignes; who being a Woman In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to Blood and Miſchief, Counſeled his Death, which was performed in the heighth of Jollitry, by diſguiſed Ruffians; <hi>ſo that inſtead of a Bridal Bed, he had an untimely Grave,</hi> when he had Reigned Forty Five Years.</p>

                     <hi>Edmund,</hi> the Fifteenth and laſt King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 794.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61951:59"/> diſcouraged) and charge the Guilt on Innocent King <hi>Edmund,</hi> becauſe he had not put the Offender to Death, as the Law then directed; which indeed, he durſt not do, the other being grown too powerful for him. And now the King being Overthrown in divers Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, his Country ſcattered over with his Slain Subjects, and moſt of the principal Towns laid in Ruines, he was conſtrained to fly for ſhelter to <hi>Framingham Caſtle,</hi> where the <hi>Danes</hi> Beſieged him, and through <hi>Famine</hi> and loſs of Men conſtraining the Garriſon to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they ſtripped the King of his Royal Robes, beat his Naked Body with Cudgels, ſcourging him till the Bones of his Ribs appeared bare, he bearing it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the while, <hi>calling on the Name of Jeſus;</hi> which ſo enraged the <hi>Pagans,</hi> That <hi>Tying him to a Poſt, they Shot him to Death with Arrows,</hi> then cut off his Head, and threw it into a Wood, which being found by a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, was Buried, together with his Body, at a place in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> bearing from thence the Name of <hi>St. Edmunds-Bury;</hi> he being ſoon after Cannonized a Saint and Martyr; And with him ceaſed the <hi>Eaſt Angle</hi> Government; there being no mention made of any more Kings that Governed it, as a diſtinct Kingdom.

                  <p>The Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi> contained the ſpacious and fertil Counties of <hi>Cornwal, Devonſhire, Dorcetſhire, Somerſetſhire, Wiltſhire, Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire:</hi> Bounded on the North, with <hi>Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Glouceſterſhire, Oxfordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol-Channel;</hi> on the Eaſt, with <hi>Suſſex, Surry,</hi> and part of <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> on the South, with the <hi>Britiſh-Ocean,</hi> and part of the <hi>Channel;</hi> on the Weſt, with the <hi>Ocean.</hi> Theſe Counties abound in plenty of <hi>Corn, Wooll, Tinn, Fruits, Cattle,</hi> and profitable <hi>Manufactures;</hi> having many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Harbours,</hi> opening advantageouſly to the Sea; ſo that growing by ſuch means <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Powerful,</hi> they failed not at length to bring under the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Uniting them in a <hi>Sole Monarchy</hi> under <hi>Egbert</hi> their Seventeenth King, as in the Series of this Hiſtory will appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cherdick,</hi> a Valiant Captain of the Low Country <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> firſt laboured to form theſe Counties into a Kingdom; but before he could do it, he had Six Years Wars with the <hi>Britains;</hi> in which he Fought a great Battel with <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> their King, and was put to the Rout; but upon his Death, which happened Two Years after by Poiſon, as has been related, <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter-Pendragon,</hi> and <hi>Hengiſts</hi> Sons were taken Priſoness;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61951:60"/> but whilſt the Victor neglected the Tents of <hi>Mars</hi> for the ſofter Alcove of <hi>Venus, viz.</hi> To ſport with the fair <hi>Igren,</hi> Wife to the Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> on whom he got the Renouned <hi>Prince Arthur,</hi> who Succeeded him as King over the <hi>Britains,</hi> the Noble Captives Eſcaped; and again advancing their Standard in the Field; were Slain with moſt of their followers. Theſe bad begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſo ſtartled <hi>Cherdrick,</hi> that he found little hopes to keep the footing he had gained; but more Forces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unexpectedly to his Aid, he reſolved to try another Battel with the <hi>Britains,</hi> which was Fought near <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> wherein Fortune turning her Wheel about, he put the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army to the Foil, killing <hi>Natauleon,</hi> one of their great Captains; and made ſo great a ſlaughter of his Enemies, that for a time he had no Interruption in ſettling his Affairs; but after the Death of <hi>

                     <hi>Chelwolf</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 598; but ſcarce was he ſettled in the Throne ere the <hi>Britains</hi> Invaded his Territories, making great Spoil; but finding they were too weak to withſtand him alone, in proceſs of time they drew the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> to their aſſiſtance; ſo that many bloody Battels were fought with various ſucceſs. In which Wars he Dyed, in the 14th Year of his Reign, leaving his Kingdom in much diſtreſs and perplexity. He was the 5th King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons.</hi>

The manner of his Death was thus: The Queen impatient of the Wrongs he did her in keeping Strumpets in his Pallace, and cauſing her ſometimes to wait on them, was at length promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to revenge the Affronts put upon her by one of them he beſt loved, and therefore having mixed Poiſon with ſome rich Wine, ſhe intended to ſend it to her in the Kings Name as a Preſent, but being unluckily called away to ſee ſome ſights that were prepared for the diverſion of the Court, ſhe left it in her Cloſet, and for haſte the Door open; when as the King coming thither before her return, and taking it for a Cordial, Drank largly of it; and ſo by the ſtrength of the Poiſon, he Dyed in three Hours; and the Queen fearing to ſuffer a cruel Death, though this had un-witingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by her means, hereupon flying into <hi>France,</hi> through Grief and Want, ſhe dyed in a miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This King Reigned Sixteen Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egbert,</hi> the Seventeenth and Laſt Petty King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 800; and whilſt he continued in this Station, before he came to be Crowned Sole Monarch, of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> Uniting the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> or Seven Kingdoms, he had great Wars with the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were aſſiſted by the <hi>Corniſh-men;</hi> which from the beginning of his Wars with them, to the time he brought them to acknowledge him their Superiour, laſted about Fourteen Years; in which time he took <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and made a ſtrict Law, <hi>That no</hi> Britain <hi>or</hi> Welſhman <hi>ſhould paſs</hi> Offa<hi>'s</hi> Ditch, <hi>without leave.</hi> Then Warring on the <hi>Mercians,</hi> he ſlew <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulf</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61951:65"/> their King; ſubdued <hi>Kent,</hi> and compelled the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Saxons,</hi> to ſubmit to him; and in a great meaſure having brought the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbrians</hi> under, graſping at the Sole Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which he concluded <hi>Fortune</hi> had, or ſoon would, chain to his Sword; he cauſed himſelf with great Pomp ſolemnly to be Crowned Soled Monarch of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> that had been, for the moſt part, till now, diſtinctly Governed by their reſpective Kings; as appears in the foregoing account of the Succeſſion of them. This was performed at <hi>Wincheſter, (with many of the Ceremonies uſed at preſent in the Coronation of our Kings)</hi> when he had Reigned over the <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi> Nineteen Years. But becauſe I am obliged to Trace the remainder of his Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> Seventeen Years, as Sole Monarch, in the next Chapter; I here omit to mention any more of his Actions.</p>
                  <p>And now to clear ſome difficulties that may ariſe as far as Hiſtory gives light into the Truth,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That although <hi>Egbert</hi> cauſed himſelf to be Crowned Sole Monarch, and abſolutely poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe Kingdoms whoſe Succeſſion of Kings ceaſed before, or when he Reigned, as that of <hi>Kent,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Saxons</hi> and <hi>South Saxon</hi> Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet others were of a longer continuance, and can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only as Tributary to him; for we find <hi>Burdred</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings, ended his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 874. <hi>viz.</hi> Thirty Eight Years after <hi>Egberts</hi> Death. And to the ſame purpoſe, it is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further, <hi>viz.</hi> where Authors make mention of a longer continuance of the Petty Kingdoms than there is any Succeſſion of Kings Recorded, the Judicious Obſervers and Comparers of Hiſtory, have looked on it as a Miſtake in them, by taking the Lieutenants, or Vice-Roys, placed by the Sole Monarchs, to Govern
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61951:66"/> under them, for petty Kings; which Error the Antient Writers of the Affairs of this Kingdom having been too lyable to, their Incoherence, in reſpect of Time, has not a little puzzled thoſe that came after them; which I have, as well as the matter will conveniently bear, without breaking the thred of Hiſtory, laboured to Reform.</p>

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61951:71"/> that ſurvived the Fatal day, retired to the extremities of <hi>Kent;</hi> where ſtraightened for Food, and roving to get it, many of them were ſlain by the Country People. This King Marryed <hi>Osburga</hi> a fair Lady, Daughter to his Butler, by whom he had <hi>Ethelbald, Ethelbert, Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> and <hi>Elfride;</hi> who Succeeded in the Kingdom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively; but ſhe Dying, he took <hi>Judith,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in a ſecond Marriage; by whom I do not find he had any Children.</p>
                  <p>In this Kings Reign the <hi>Picts</hi> were deſtroyed by <hi>Kenneth</hi> King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> their chiefeſt City <hi>Camelon</hi> Stormed, and as well Women and Children as Men, who retired thither for ſafety, put to the Sword, in revenge of the Death of <hi>Alpine</hi> the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Father, who being Overthrown by <hi>Burdus</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> was taken Priſoner, and had his Head ſtruck off on a publick Scaffold, and fixed on the Wall of <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but ſoon taken thence by ſome <hi>Scots</hi> who came thither in <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Habit; and ſo implacable were the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the utter extirpating this Nation (which had long ſtood a boundary between them and the Southern parts of the Iſland, being in a manner placed in the middle of it) that having deſtroyed all the People that fell into their hands, they ſlew their Cattel, and ſuffered them to Rot on the Ground; rooted up their Corn, and layed their Towns and Villages level with the Ground; not ſparing Churches, nor any Religious Houſes, purſuing the Flyers to their laſt Refuge, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtrong <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Maidens,</hi> now called <hi>Edenbourough Caſtle,</hi> ſtraightly Beſieging them; ſo that the Beſieged having endured extream <hi>Famine,</hi> and diſpairing of relief, deſperately Sallying, broke (in the Night time) through the Leagure; and as many as eſcaped, fled into <hi>England,</hi> craving Aid of <hi>Ethelwolfs</hi> Lieutenants, or Tributary Regents, in <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61951:71"/> and other Northern Counties; but little was done at this time, by reaſon the King expected an Invaſion by the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were preparing in <hi>Denmark,</hi> to ſuccour their diſtreſſed Forces that kept but ſlender footing in <hi>England;</hi> and others of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who before had eſcaped the miſerable deſolation of their Country, fled to <hi>Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> and there, in conſideration of Refuge and preſent Support, reſigned their Intereſt in <hi>Pictland,</hi> in their own, and the Names of the reſt of their Nation, that ſurvived the ſlaughter: Which giving the <hi>Danes</hi> a colourable Title to make their Claim, occaſioned great calamities to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the ſubduing the former, after a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed War, as in the ſequel will appear.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell the <hi>Pictiſh Kingdom,</hi> and was Annexed to <hi>Scotland, Anno Dom.</hi> 839. After, as ſome Hiſtorians Record, they had continued under a Succeſſion of Kings 1173 Years. But its ſetting in Blood happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not without dreadful Omens and Prodigies; at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melon,</hi> their chief City, the <hi>Biſhops Croſier Staff,</hi> he Officiating at the <hi>Altar,</hi> was reduced to <hi>Aſhes</hi> by <hi>Lightning:</hi> A dreadful <hi>Comet</hi> appeared, and two <hi>Firey Armies</hi> were ſeen in the Air, running at each other with <hi>Burning Spears;</hi> a noiſe of <hi>Claſhing of Arms,</hi> and <hi>Neighing of Horſes,</hi> was affirmed to be heard in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Pictland,</hi> without any viſibility of either; which then were little minded, but afterward looked on as the Forerunners of the dire calamities that enſued.</p>
                  <p>Upon this deſtruction of his Neighbours Kingdom, <hi>Kenwolf</hi> was much perplexed, becauſe till now they ſtood as a Barricado to hinder the Incurſion of the <hi>Scots;</hi> whereupon he ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Kenneth,</hi> peaceably to ſuffer thoſe of that Nation that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his and other Countries, to return and Rebuild their Ruinated Towns; but he would by no means
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61951:72"/> harken to it, which conſtrained him to Fortify the Towns in the Northern Marches, and put ſtrong Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons into them. And having a great love for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> of whoſe number he had been, he freed all <hi>Church-Lands</hi> from Tribute and Regal Services; and being deſirous to ſee <hi>Rome,</hi> of whoſe Magnificence he had heard many wonderful Relations, ſettling his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the beſt manner he could, with divers of his <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi> he Sailed thither, and was Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſuch Magnificence, that in recompence of his Reception, he confirmed <hi>Peter Pence</hi> to that <hi>See;</hi> and after his Return gave <hi>Annually,</hi> during his Life, <hi>Three Hundred Marks</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>BEdfordſhire</hi> is a very Pleaſant In-Land County; it is Bounded with <hi>Northamptonſhire, Huntingtonſhire, Cambridgſhire, Hartfordſhire, Buckinghamſhire, &amp;c.</hi> It is plentiful in Cattle, Fowle, Corn, fat Paſtures, Forreſts, Parks, repleniſhed with ſtore of Timber and Deer; conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Plains, pleaſant Valleys, and gradual riſing Hills, and is ſaid to yeild the beſt Barley in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in the North parts.</p>
                     <p>It containes One Hundred and Sixteen Pariſhes, Nine Hundreds, Ten Market Towns, and One conſiderable River. It ſends Members to Parliament Four, <hi>viz. Bedford</hi> two, and two Knights for the County.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bedford,</hi> the Shire Town, has been to its coſt the Scene of much Action; eſpecially in the Wars between King <hi>Stephen</hi> and the Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> Mother to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and in the Wars of the <hi>Barons,</hi> againſt King <hi>John,</hi> and was raz'd to the ground by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, but ſoon Rebuilt, and ever ſince flouriſhed in much tranquility and ſplendor. In a Chappel not far from the Town, <hi>Offa</hi> the great King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> was Buryed, which being demoliſhed by the overflowing of the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> his <hi>Spectrum</hi> is ſaid often to have appeared on the Water of that River.</p>
                     <p>There is a little Rivolet at <hi>Aſply</hi> near <hi>Wobourn</hi> in this County, which is famous for its Petrifying Quality, being ſaid to <hi>Turn Wood into Stone;</hi> and that a Wooden Ladder happening to fall into it, was ſome time after taken up again all Stone. And that not only the Pivolet or Brook, but the Earth in the Banks of it has the ſame Vertue. So that it is juſtly accounted one of the Wonders of our Iſle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dean</hi> is a pleaſant Town, Eminent for the Birth of <hi>Francis Dillingham,</hi> a very Learned Man; as <hi>Layton

                     <p>The River <hi>Ouſe</hi> Waters this County with its pleaſant Meanders, paſſing through <hi>Bedford,</hi> and hath over it a handſom <hi>Stone Bridge,</hi> with two <hi>Gates</hi> upon it.

                        <hi>COrnwal,</hi> the Antient <hi>Cornubij,</hi> ſeemes to take its Name from its puſhing into the <hi>Sea</hi> in the form of a Horn. It abounds with Mines of Tin, which is the beſt and fineſt in all <hi>Europe;</hi> Stone Quarries, Corn, Fruits, Cattle; and, as ſome hold, there might be much <hi>Silver</hi> Digged in ſeveral places: It is the Extremity of <hi>England</hi> Weſtward. On the North, and partly the Weſt, it has the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea; on the South, the Channel; and on the Eaſt, <hi>Devonſhire:</hi> It is divided into Nine Hundreds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>161</hi> Pariſhes, <hi>22</hi> Market Towns, and ſeven Rivers. It ſends Members to Parliament <hi>44, viz. Bodmin</hi> two, <hi>Baſſiney</hi> two, <hi>Camelford</hi> two, <hi>Dunhived</hi> two, <hi>Eaſtlow</hi> two, <hi>Fowey</hi> two, <hi>Grampound</hi> two, <hi>Helſton</hi> two, <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> two, <hi>St. Ives</hi> two, <hi>Kellington</hi> two, <hi>Leskerk</hi> two, <hi>Loſtwithiall</hi> two, <hi>St. Mawes</hi> two, <hi>St. Michael</hi> two, <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> two, <hi>Penryn</hi> two, <hi>Port-Pigham</hi> two, <hi>Saltaſh</hi> two, <hi>Tregonye</hi> two, <hi>Truro</hi> two, and two Knights of the Shire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camelford,</hi> in this County, is very famous for the Battel where <hi>Mordred</hi> was Slain, and King <hi>Arthur</hi> received his Mortal Wound. There has lately been digged up peices of Armour in that place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tintagal</hi> Caſtle gave King <hi>Arthur</hi> (that Miracle of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Valour) Birth. At <hi>Caſtle-Dennis,</hi> the Ruins of the <hi>Daines</hi> Trenches, upon their firſt Invaſion, are to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Germans</hi> is a very ſtately Place, and was Antiently an <hi>Epiſcopal See,</hi> but removed to <hi>Bodmin,</hi> and from thence by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor to <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> where it remains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cradoc</hi> is likewiſe noted for the Birth of <hi>John Traviſa,</hi> a Learned Writer. This County is famed for its exceeding high Mount overlooking the Sea, with a curious Bay on which ſtands <hi>Penſance,</hi> commanding the Harbour.

                  <p>
                     <hi>ALfrid,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Elfride,</hi> Fourth Son of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf,</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> when his Brother Dyed, was fetched from thence to ſuccour and ſupport his Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country, at the point to be loſt to a Mercileſs Enemy; he had the Crown placed on his Head <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 872, and finding a greater neceſſity to be in the Field than the Pallace, he cauſed Forces to be raiſed in all his Dominions free from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Subjection; for in ſtead of befriending the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> and <hi>Mercian</hi> Dukes, that had joyned with them againſt <hi>Ethelred,</hi> they ſorely oppreſſed thoſe Countries; making them as it were Slaves to perform all ſervile offices, not leaving them any thing they could properly call their owne; Billeting Souldiers in their Houſes, as Guards over them, rather than Gueſts, who conſtrained the poor Inhabitants to feed them with what ſhould ſuſtain the wants of themſelves, and their neceſſitous Children; as alſo to ſupply them with Money, or elſe their Lives were liable at every diſtaſte taken by their Lord <hi>Danes,</hi> to pay for the Defect.</p>
                  <p>Such treatment as this being the uſual Rewards of all thoſe who by their own Treachery and perfidiouſneſs endeavour to bring in Foreigners to Subdue and Enſlave
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61951:87"/> their Native Country: And yet this is the ſole Aim of thoſe Brutes among us, that glory in the Name of <hi>Iacobites,</hi> who would bring in the late King <hi>James</hi> by the Arms of the <hi>French,</hi> and thereby ſubject the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the will of that inſulting Tyrant <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and ſo entail Slavery for ever on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Poſterity. And if they only were to feel it, might they have their wiſhes; But ſince others muſt ſuffer with them, ſhould their Attempts ſucceed, I hope that God that has ſo lately brought to light their curſed Deſignes, will ſtill continue to defeat all the enterprizes of ſuch Profligate Villans, and preſerve the Sacred Life of His Majeſty from all their Helliſh Machinations, and thereby theſe Nations in that Peace and happineſs which through God's goodneſs they now enjoy under His Majeſties Auſpicious Reign. I hope the Reader will pardon this Digreſſion, which only Zeal to my King and Country, and a juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt thoſe Miſcreants, who are continually labouring to embroil us in Blood and Confuſion, has Extorted from me. — But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>By theſe their Cruel and Arbitrary proceedings, the King finding no Truce nor Oathes were binding on their part, reſolved to gather his Forces into a Body, and give them Battel, cauſing Publick Prayers to be put up for his ſucceſs, but before it could be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, upon notice of it, they Marched into <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> taking <hi>Exceter,</hi> whilſt they were parlying with the King for a Truce; after which he narrowly eſcaped the Ambuſh they layed to intrap him and take his Life; whereupon having gotten as many Forces as he could together, he purſued them in their March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which City they intended to Sack; but they facing about and a fierce Fight enſuing, the King was overthrown, his Army ſcattered, and he forced to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61951:87"/> fly into the Woods for ſhelter, where fiting his <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrows</hi> in a poor Shepherds Cottage, he was ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved by the Houſwife (ſhe not knowing him) for letting a <hi>Cake</hi> burn on the Hearth, for want of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſaying, <hi>How now, you Lubber, muſt I give you Houſe-roome for doing nothing? Why did not you turn the Bread? Yet I warant you would be ready to Eate it ere it is half Baked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, finding he was in great ſtraights, and much grieved at the miſery his Subjects groaned under, at laſt bethought him of a Stratagem to Redreſs it; <hi>viz.</hi> He put himſelf into the Habit of a <hi>Bard</hi> or <hi>Harper,</hi> and went into the <hi>Daniſh Camp,</hi> playing on his <hi>Harp</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected, and by that means taking notice of their Luxurious manner of living, and ſluggiſh ſecurity, he went thence and collected his ſcattered Forces, and falling upon them near <hi>Abingdon</hi> in the Night time, when they little expected the danger ſo near, he made an incredible ſlaughter of the un-prepared <hi>Danes,</hi> ſo that nothing but Crys and claſhing of Swords were heard throughout the Valleys; and here <hi>Hubba,</hi> one of their great Captains, was Slain, and their <hi>Banner Rafan</hi> taken, being the <hi>Danes</hi> chief Standard, having on it the figure of a <hi>Raven</hi> done in Nedlework, Imbrodered by the Daughters of <hi>Lodbroke,</hi> Siſters to <hi>Hungar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> which was in high Eſtimation, becauſe they had Propheſied Victory ſhould ever attend the <hi>Danes</hi> wherever it was Diſplayed in the Field. And ſoon after the Battel was over, <hi>Hubba</hi> was Buryed, and a mighty Hill of Stones caſt on him as a Monument, which gave Name to the place of his Burial, which is called <hi>Hubbleſtow,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> to this day.</p>
                  <p>The King purſuing this advantage, and for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of his Souldiers having ſhared the Spoiles taken from the <hi>Danes</hi> amongſt them, followed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61951:88"/> Enemy, and within a while gave them two other great Defeats, one at <hi>Ethan-Dun,</hi> the other at <hi>Rhoaf-ceaſter,</hi> now <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> raiſing the Siege they had layed before it.</p>
                  <p>After this, they Recruited and brought another <hi>Raven Standard,</hi> to the Field, in hopes of better ſucceſs. But near <hi>Alesford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> they received another great Overthrow, ſo that the Waters in the Ditches, Ponds, and Rivers adjacent, were coloured with Blood; and from thence he chaced them into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> through the <hi>Thames,</hi> in paſſing which River, purſu'd by the Enemy, and their own fears, many (for haſte) miſſing the Fords, were ſmothered in the Deeps.</p>
                  <p>This however ſufficed not the King, whoſe main Aime was to drive them out of the Kingdom, and ſo give Peace and Reſt to his tired and diſtreſſed Subjects; wherefore he Marched to a place then called <hi>Beaufleet,</hi> where <hi>Haſtinges</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> who newly arrived with Eighty Ships, had fortified and received his flying Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and here likewiſe Fortune was on his ſide, he giving them the Rout; and laſtly they were quite diſcomfited at <hi>Boultington</hi> by <hi>Severn,</hi> and at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Meſig,</hi> or <hi>Merſey</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at the River <hi>Ligea</hi> or <hi>Ley,</hi> which goeth to <hi>Ware,</hi> and carryed up their Ships, but <hi>Alfred</hi> Trenching and Drying it, they could not bring them back; whereupon they fled into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and then to <hi>Denmark.</hi>

                     <p>THE County of <hi>Derby,</hi> tho' ſomewhat Hilly in divers parts, yet it is a very pleaſant County, watered with the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> and other Rivers abounding with Fiſh: It has in it a great number of Forreſts and Parks ſtored with Deer; It breeds an excellent ſort of Large Cattle and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Sheep: It abounds alſo with various ſorts of Stones, as <hi>Free-Stone,</hi> or durable <hi>Greet-Stone;</hi> and in ſome places <hi>Lime-Stone,</hi> which is uſeful both in Building and Husbandry, for the Manuring of the Land. Here is alſo <hi>Alabaſter, Cryſtal,</hi> Black and Grey <hi>Marble,</hi> which is not only very durable, but Poliſhes well. And for <hi>Mill-Stones</hi> and <hi>Whet-Stones,</hi> here are ſeveral Quarries of them, in the working whereof many Perſons are Employed. But the chiefeſt Commodity of this County is Lead; which for the Goodneſs and Plenty thereof, yields to no Place in the World: And famous for this, is the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Derby-ſhire,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Devil's Arſe;</hi> which is indeed the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing in this County. This Peak or Cave called the <hi>Devil's Arſe,</hi> is a great Rock or Caſtle upon an high Hill, under which there is a Cave in the ground of a vaſt bigneſs; the Name ſeemes to be taken from its having two Buttocks ſticking out in form like a Mans, bending to the Ground: The Arch of the Rock is extream high, and through it Drops
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61951:100"/> of Water are continually falling: Thoſe that are minded to enter into it muſt have good ſtore of Lights, for going between two Rocks near together, they looſe the ſight of Day; which makes the place look dreadful and affrighting; and perhaps gave riſe to all thoſe fabulous ſtories of Spirits and Phantoms, which are reported of it; the recital whereof, is neither worth my Pains, nor the Readers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eldenhole</hi> is another remarkabls place, and one of the Wonders of the Peak; It is diſtant two miles from <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Town in the High-Peak. The hole of this Cave is about <hi>30</hi> Yards long, and <hi>15</hi> Yards broad on the Top; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending directly down into the Earth, which is much ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when it cometh <hi>40</hi> Yards deep: The Waters which trickle down from the Top thereof do congeal into Stone, and hang like Iſicles in the root of it: Some are hollow within, and grow Taper-wiſe, very white, and not unlike to Cryſtal.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Wonder of the Peak is that of <hi>Buxton-Wells,</hi> where nine Springs ariſe out of a Rock, within the compaſs of eight or nine Yards, eight of which are Warm, and the ninth very Cold: Theſe Springs run from under a Square Building of <hi>Free-Stone;</hi> and about <hi>60</hi> paces off, receive another hot Spring, from a Well incloſed with four flat Stones, called St. <hi>Ann;</hi> near unto which another cold Spring bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up.

                  <p>This <hi>Edgar</hi> Yearly rid the Circuit, to take notice of the abuſes and corruptions of his Judges, and ſeverely Puniſhed their remiſneſs in the Adminiſtration of the Laws: But notwithſtanding all theſe good Qualities, he was very much blemiſh'd with Incontinency, not ſparing Wives or Daughters, where his deſires lead him to purſue the enjoyment of his unlawful Pleaſures: He begat a Daughter, whom he named <hi>Edith,</hi> on <hi>Wolfe-child</hi> a veiled <hi>Nun,</hi> who was afterward for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum of Money <hi>Cannonized</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to gaine the poſſeſſion of <hi>Odwina,</hi> a Weſtern Dukes Daughter, her Mother whom he ſolicited to give her into his Arms, preferring the preſervation of her <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity</hi> to the Kings Anger, and all his Golden Promiſes, contrived a Stratagem to defeat him, which ſhe effected, by laying her waiting Maid in her Daughters Bed, with whoſe wanton toying in the Dark he was ſo pleaſed, that tho' he diſcovered the Fraud the next Morning, he not only commended the Dutcheſs, but gave his Bedfellow the Reward he had promiſed the Yong Lady, and kept her as his <hi>Concubine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, hearing by Fame of the great Beauty of Duke <hi>Orgarius</hi>'s Daughter, that ſhe was even a <hi>Phoenix</hi> in nature, for incomparable Features, being by this time a Widower, he reſolved if what was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proved true, to take her to Wife; and in order to be better certified, he ſent Earl <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> one of his Courtiers, to view her, who falling in Love with the Lady, wooed her for himſelf, and Married her, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to the King, by telling him, <hi>That ſhe had Beauty enough for a Subiect, but not for ſo great a Prince:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61951:114"/> this did not ſo well ſatisfy him, but he reſolved to ſee her, and ſo Invited himſelf to the Earls Houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelwold,</hi> miſtruſting to what intent he had done it, being conſcious his Wives Beauty would enflame him, laboured to excuſe his unpreparedneſs, but in vain; whereupon he acquainted his Wife with it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to deforme herſelf, by appearing in a homely Dreſs, and by diſcolouring her Face, if ſhe had any regard to his <hi>Life,</hi> or her own <hi>Chaſtity;</hi> telling her how her prevailing <hi>Charms</hi> had made him betray his Truſt.</p>
                  <p>But this Ambitious Woman (proud of her Beauty) gathering from his diſcourſe ſhe might have been a Queen, and not now altogether out of hopes to be ſo, promiſed the Earl (for the better hiding her Anger) to obey him; but on the contrary, when the King was ſet at Dinner, ſhe came before him Adorned with Jewells, and all her coſtly Ornaments, having much added by Art to her Natural Beauties, ſo that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Eyes like a glittering Angel; yet he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his Anger with <hi>Ethelwold</hi> for the preſent, till that Afternoon going a Hunting with the Earl in his Forreſt, he ſingled him out, and after many reproaches, ſtruck him through with his Javelin, as he was about to fall on his Knees and begg Pardon; and in a little time after took the Lady to Wife, by whom he had <hi>Ethelred</hi> afterward King of <hi>England.</hi> For this and his other wicked practices, <hi>Dunſtan</hi> whome he had made a Biſhop, and his great Favorite, Enjoyned him as a Penance, Not to wear his <hi>Crown</hi> for ſeven Years, which Injunction he ſubmitted to, but left not his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious courſes.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Edgar</hi> brought the Kingdom to a Flouriſhing condition, and is accounted the greateſt of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchs, being once at <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> he had eight Kings
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61951:115"/> and Princes to Row his Barge on the River <hi>Dee,</hi> as we have already noted, in our Remarks on <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> He is ſaid to compaſs the Iſland with almoſt an incredible Navy of Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> 3600, ſettling and ſtrengthening the Sea-Ports, leaving Guard-Ships to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Landing of <hi>Pirates</hi> or other Enemies; by which Undertaking he brought ſuch a Terror on <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that their King ſued for Peace, and payed an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> Tribute to have it confirmed.</p>
                  <p>He Reſtored and Founded 47 <hi>Monaſteries:</hi> And in the preſence of his Nobility, on <hi>Chriſtmas Day, Anno Dom.</hi> 974, he Confirmed the Abby of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> which his Couſin <hi>Alwin</hi> had Founded, and made the Abby which Biſhop <hi>Oſwald</hi> had Builded, a <hi>Cathedral Church;</hi> He brought the <hi>Welſh</hi> under an intire Subjection to <hi>England,</hi> aloting their Princes Penſions, as his Servants, clearing the Seas of Rovers, and intended to War on <hi>France,</hi> to compol that King to a reparation of the Damages his Merchants had ſuſtained on the <hi>French</hi> Coaſts, by Embargoes and Seiſures of their Goods. But whilſt great things were in his mind, his Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries having much waſted his Natural Strength, he Dyed when he had Reigned Sixteen Years, and was honourably Entombed at <hi>Glaſtenbury;</hi> which as yet boaſts ſome remains of his Monument.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth Year of his Reign, the Heavens ſeemed as on Fire, the Stars to appearance darted Beams at each other, as if Creation had been about to diſſolve. A Monſterous Fiſh was taken on the Coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> with a Face and Hair like a Man, and a Scaly Circlet like a Coronet on its Head, and upon its being drawn up, ſent forth a mighty noiſe like the roaring of a Lion.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61951:119"/> according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Cannons;</hi> and a place for that purpoſe was prepared in a large upper Room where <hi>Dunſtan</hi> (as chief Orator for the Monks) had cunningly placed his Chair on a Poſt or Beam ſtrongly fixed; and as ſome Authors believe had contrived a Device, by taking out ſome Pins, to let the Floor fall, upon a ſignal given; ſo the preſs being very great, after a hot Debate had been held for a while, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Agreed on, <hi>Dunſtan</hi> ſtamping, and ſaying, <hi>They ſhall fall before us, &amp;c.</hi> The Floor firſt trembled, as with the motion of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and then fell down, leaving nothing but <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s Chair that had been ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated aloft, which being looked upon as, and cryed up for a <hi>Miracle,</hi> in the behalfe of the Monks, they thereupon carried the day: And the Married Prieſts were left at liberty to Enjoy their Wives, but outed of their Benefices.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>EDmund Ironſide</hi> began his Reign in a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome time, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1016, when the <hi>Danes</hi> had poſſeſſed the greater part of the Kingdom; taking on him the <hi>Crown</hi> rather out of pity to his bleeding <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> than deſire of Soveraignty; and indeed did more than could be reaſonably expected from him, with ſuch ſlender Forces and little Treaſure; for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly ſeting up his Standard to recover a great part of the Kingdom at a point to be loſt, he gave <hi>Canute</hi> Battel at <hi>Penham</hi> near <hi>Gillingham,</hi> where he Overthrew him with much ſlaughter on both ſides; then he Fought him again with the like ſucceſs at <hi>Shereſtane</hi> in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire;</hi> and likewiſe in a third Battel near that place, notwithſtanding <hi>Ederick</hi> the Traiterous Duke, though ſeemingly ſiding with the King, gave out in the mideſt of the Battel that the King was Slain; upon which Defeat, the <hi>Danes</hi> fled to <hi>London,</hi> and were purſued by <hi>Edmund</hi> who drove them thence. He diſcomfited them at <hi>Oteford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and had clear'd the Kingdom of them but for <hi>Edrick</hi>'s Treachery, who in a ſixth Battel the King Fought at <hi>Aſſendune</hi> near <hi>Roachfor</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> commanding a part of the Kings Army, he purpoſely fled, upon which the Souldiers fell into Rout and Diſorder, ſo that the King was compelled for his ſafety to Retreat towards <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> whither his ſcattered Forces reſorted to him; and after a little Refreſhment he cauſed other Troops to be raiſed, and again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his Standard in the Field, often Skirmiſhing with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſlaying great numbers of them, ſending likewiſe a Challenge to <hi>Canute</hi> their King, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61951:128"/> end the War by ſingle Combate; who accepting it, the two Kings in the ſight of both Armies prepared on the day appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> in a little Iſland called <hi>Olway,</hi> made ſo by the winding of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;</hi> and about ten in the Morning the Combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, both of them having ſtrong and large Swords: They had not long continued it, and given to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mighty Blows, but the Blood flowed plentifully from their Wounds, and <hi>Edmund</hi> being a Prince of exceeding ſtrength, preſſed ſo hard upon <hi>Canute,</hi> that driving him to the Brink of the River, he cryed out (tho almoſt Breathleſs and Faint, by effuſion of Blood) <hi>What need is there for us, Noble King, thus to endanger our Lives? The Kingdom is large enough for us both: If you will then conſent to divide it between us, our hands will be ſtrengthened againſt our Enemies, and we ſhall Live together in Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, as Brothers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edmund</hi> pauſing hereupon a while, conſidered That if he ſlew <hi>Canute,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> might not ſtand to the Award of leaving the Land, as having experienced their breach of Truce, and that being moſtly <hi>Pagans,</hi> they held it but a ſmall matter to break their Word or Oaths with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that other <hi>Commanders</hi> might come over with freſh Forces to work new Troubles, the Country being already very much waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he at laſt concluded (upon <hi>Canute</hi>'s dropping his Sword, in token he Submitted) to ſhake Hands with him, and embrace the offer: Whereupon King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> having the firſt Lot, choſe the <hi>Southern, Eaſtern,</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Counties,</hi> as far as the Borders of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> then ſeemed to be contented with the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Counties,</hi> as far as the Borders of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Swearing to aſſiſt each other againſt all Invaders; and for a time they lived Peaceably in <hi>Co-Partnerſhip.</hi> But <hi>Ederick,</hi> the Traytorous Duke, perceiving the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61951:129"/> 
                     <hi>Danes</hi> by reaſon of the ſwarms that came frequently from <hi>Denmark</hi> to be the ſtronger, laboured to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf with <hi>Canute,</hi> (tho' he held fair with <hi>Edmund,</hi> who would not be perſwaded by his faithful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to take him out of the way, tho' his Treaſons were apparent:) And thinking he ſhould merit much of the <hi>Dane</hi> by deſtroying King <hi>Edmund;</hi> at leaſt, That he ſhould have ſome part of the Kingdom aſſigned him; he one day, as the King was disburdening Nature at the lower end of his Garden, conveyed himſelf by a back way under the Vault, and with Impious Hands <hi>Thruſt a ſhort Spear in at his Fundament and up his Body till it peirced his Heart;</hi> ſo that giving an extraordinary Groan, he inſtantly Dyed.</p>
                  <p>The Traytor not ſatisfied with this, but deſirous to carry ſome Teſtimonial of the Regicide with him, crept up at the hole, and with his Sword cut off the Kings Head, and ſo privately made his Eſcape to <hi>Canute;</hi> and at his approaching him, cryed out, <hi>Hail, Sole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of</hi> England! <hi>Behold the Head of thy Go-Partner: Canute</hi> inwardly deteſting ſo baſe a Treachery, yet outwardly deſſembling his Reſentment, received it as a Grateful Preſent, promiſing the Bringer to <hi>Advance him above all the Nobles of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in one ſence he did it, as he deſerved; for whilſt he was expecting high Promotion, he cauſed him to be Arreſted, and his Head being ſtricken off, was placed on the higheſt part of the Tower; for by this time he was advanced with an Army to <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (upon the conſternation they were in at the ſurprizing News of the Kings Death) not oppoſing him, in a ſhort time the whole Kingdom ſubmitted to him; ſo that being Crowned Sole Monarch, he put a Period to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Reign, about 566 Years from the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi>

                  <p>BEing come to ſpeak of a Succeſſion of Kings different in Nation from the former, it will not be improper to give an account briefly of the Original of the Nation that gave birth to the firſt of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Original of the <hi>Danes</hi> is concluded (by ſome Authors) to have been from <hi>Scythia;</hi> That a Famine extreamly raging in that Country, divers <hi>Colonies</hi> had left it, and ranging to ſeek Food, found out an Iſland called <hi>Scandia</hi> ſituate Northward, not far from the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61951:133"/> continent of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and in time growing too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous for that ſcanty place, they Warred on the <hi>Danij,</hi> and ſo long continued it, that they graſped the Kingdom with ſo hard a hand, as to this day it is not wreſted from the Race of them; and from thence they called the Country <hi>Danes-Mark,</hi> or portion of Land, now corruptly <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Peninſule, ſo called by reaſon it is almoſt an Iſland, as it is now held by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King, that is properly called <hi>Denmark,</hi> is in Length Eighty Miles, and Twenty in Breadth; having but little firm Land; being divided into many Iſlands; whereof <hi>Jutland,</hi> for its bigneſs, is the chief: It borders upon <hi>Germany</hi> and is a near Neighbour to the lower <hi>Friſia;</hi> it is difficult to determine whether it receives greater Benefit than Damage from the Sea; for often by the violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts the Banks and Fences being forced by the Waves, the Water not only covers the Fields for a long time, but by the ſuddainneſs of the Deluge deſtroys many <hi>Cattle</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and as well Stately Buildings as Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cottages: And the Country is full of Woods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtore of Deer. The Iſland of <hi>Frunen</hi> is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the main Land by a narrow Arm of the Sea: To the Weſtward of it lieth <hi>Juta,</hi> to the Eaſt <hi>Slayland,</hi> which, for the Beauty and Fertility of it, is to be preferred before all the other Iſlands belonging to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King. In it is ſituate <hi>Copenhagen</hi> the principal reſidence of the King, alſo <hi>Roſchilt</hi> the place of their Burial; near unto which is the Iſland of <hi>Scandia,</hi> the firſt Habitation of the <hi>Danes</hi> in thoſe parts, as moſt conclude. But now to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> belongs <hi>Norway,</hi> formerly a diſtinct Kingdom, and ſome other Countries, which render his Territories much larger than when the <hi>Danes</hi> firſt poſſeſſed it.</p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61951:134"/> Brother, King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with private Inſtructions to make them away; but he deteſting ſo baſe a crime, Transferred them to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Dyed; but <hi>Edward</hi> getting favour at Court and being a Prince endowed with much manly Beauty, and excellent Parts, <hi>Agatha</hi> Siſter to the Empreſs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> fell in Love with him, to whom he was Married, and by her had <hi>Edgar</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Etheling,</hi> who Dyed without Iſſue; <hi>Margaret,</hi> who Married <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> ſhe had Iſſue <hi>Chriſtian</hi> a Veiled Nun, <hi>Edgar, David,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> all three Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from this Line, as alſo <hi>Maud</hi> wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, Mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; ſo that the deſign of making away theſe Princes abroad, by a wonderful Providence turned in the end to the Advantage of both Kingdoms, in reſtoring the <hi>Saxon</hi> Line after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt to <hi>England,</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and producing many worthy Kings in <hi>Scotland</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61951:134"/> Laws for the better ſettlement of his Kingdom; and for the more firmly founding them, he called a Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is commended for his averſion to Diſſemblers, Traitors, and Flatterers, for one of the latter having told him <hi>He was Soveraign King not only of the Land but the Sea, and not only his People but the Winds and Waves were ſubject to his Command;</hi> to diſprove and upbraid the <hi>Paraſite,</hi> being at <hi>Southampton</hi> he cauſed his Chair to be placed on the Sand, and <hi>Commanded the Sea that it ſhould not ſwell to wet his Royal Robes;</hi> but the Waves Rowling towards the Shoar, in their wonted Flowings, Daſhed him up to the Thighs, whereupon riſing haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaid to his Attendants, <hi>Now you ſee all the Might and Power of Kings is but Vanity, for none is worthy to have the Name of King, but he that hath all things ſubject to his Laws;</hi> and from that time, as ſeveral Authors affirm, he not only Baniſhed all Flatterers from the Court, but refuſed to wear his <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Third Year of his Reign with a great Navy he Sailed to <hi>Denmark,</hi> that Country being then Invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> who had over-run the larger part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and overthrowing them in a bloody Battel, Slaying their chief Leaders, he chaſed the reſt out of his Kingdom, and cauſes <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> to be Builded on the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> to ſecure it againſt their Incurſions. And ſo returning with Victory, he was received at <hi>London</hi> in Triumph, and having ſettled his Affairs in a flouriſhing condition, the Kingdom thereby much recovered its Antient Renown, and he having received the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> a conſiderable time before, hearing of the Magnificence of <hi>Rome,</hi> and deſirous to ſee its ſtately Structures, the manner of their Living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went thither, not Royally Attended, but as a <hi>Pilgrim;</hi> where nevertheleſs being known, he was received with

                  <p>
                     <hi>HArrold,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Harefoot,</hi> (from his Swiftneſs in Runing, Leaping and Vaulting) Succeeded his Father, Crowned <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1036; He was Second Son to <hi>Canute,</hi> and upon his coming to the Crown was much oppoſed by <hi>Goodwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> a Perſon very Powerful, and a Politick Intreaguer of thoſe times, to make Factions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by his liberal Promiſes, and preſent Renuntiation of Taxes, he won the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and Lords on the North ſide the <hi>Thames</hi> to his Party; and having thus far prevailed, he ſtrengthened his Hand by liberally diſpoſing of Gratuities to ſuch as had done him any good offices; he promoted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Places of Truſt and Honour, ſending away more of the <hi>Danes;</hi> than in doing which, he could lay no greater obligation upon them: For Time, as yet, had not worn out the Mortal Hatred between the two Nations. He took off likewiſe a good part of the oppreſſing Tax called <hi>Dane-Gelt,</hi> which the People not without much diſcontent had laboured under, eſpecially in the <hi>Northern Counties,</hi> many Years.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Goodwin</hi> Earl of Kent, perceiving his Clandeſtine Practices too weak to enfeeble the Kings Intereſt in his Subjects affections, like cunning States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſolves to ſtruggle no longer againſt this Tide of Fortune and Succeſs; and thereupon, to make fair with him, entered upon an Inhumane Project, <hi>viz.</hi> To betray into his Hands <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Alfride,</hi> Sons to <hi>Ethelred</hi> and <hi>Emma,</hi> Born at <hi>Iſlip</hi> by <hi>Oxford,</hi> but brought up the greater part of their time in <hi>Normandy;</hi> and ſo cunningly this Traitor to his Country worked the deſign, as knowing <hi>Harrold</hi> by any means was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61951:138"/> to deſtroy them, as being the rightful Heirs of the <hi>Saxon Line,</hi> that by ſpecious pretences of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Honour, and how alſo herſelf might much profit by it, and always ſtand high in the Kings favour, he ſo dealt with Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> that won by guilded Flatteries, and not perceiving the Mortal Hook covered with the Tempting Bait, ſhe was eaſily perſwaded to Write to them on this occaſion; which being ſeconded by <hi>Goodwin</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Innocent Princes</hi> were decoy'd over, and brought as Lambs to the Slaughter; for no ſooner had the <hi>Dane</hi> got them in his power, but contrary to his Promiſe, he cauſed <hi>Alfride</hi>'s Eyes to be put out, and yet not ſo contented, his Belly was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Razor, and one end of his Bowells being faſtened to a Poſt, he was forced about it by the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſharp Ponyards, till he had twiſted them out, and ſo dyed a miſerable death; which is held to have ſtruck <hi>Goodwin,</hi> the Author of this Miſchief, with ſo great a Remorſe, that he could neither Reſt in the Day, nor Sleep in the Night, without hideous and fearful Dreams, till he contributed to the Eſcape of <hi>Edward</hi> the other Brother, who luckily got away a ſmall time before he was to be Murthered by the like, or other as cruel Torments, by which his Brother fell a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Policy of State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harrold</hi> ſuppoſing he had been defeated of the ſecond Game by the contrivance of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> (for <hi>Goodwin</hi> Swore himſelf unknowing of any thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it) determined to put her to death; but cooling a little on his raſh Decree, and conſidering ſhe was near Allyed to a Powerful Prince, his Neighbour, and had been Wife to two Kings, the laſt of them being his Father, he changed the Sentence into one ſomewhat leſs ſevere: For firſt he ſeized on all her Treaſure and Poſſeſſions, which were very conſiderable; and that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61951:139"/> not being thought a ſufficient Puniſhment, he Baniſhed her in a manner Naked; ſo that under ſuch a diſgrace, and in that poor condition, being aſhamed to go into <hi>Normandy,</hi> her own Country, ſhe got leave to paſs the Seas for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where ſhe was received Honourably by the Earl of that Province, and there ſhe continued, for the moſt part, till the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Succeſſion failed, and her Son <hi>Edward,</hi> afterward called the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> was Invited over to take upon him the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this <hi>Harrold</hi> fell Sick at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there Dyed, when he had Reigned Four Years: He was the Seventeenth Sole Monarch of <hi>England,</hi> and Second of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Line, and Reigned Four Years, being firſt Buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and after held to be removed to St. <hi>Clements Danes,</hi> without <hi>Temple-Barr.</hi>

                  <p>KIng <hi>Edward</hi> Dying Iſſueleſs, tho' <hi>Edgar Etheling</hi> was the next Heir to the Crown, yet <hi>Harrold</hi> (Son to <hi>Goodwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> by his Wife <hi>Sitha,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Swain</hi> the Younger, King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) having Ingratiated himſelf into the Favour of the leading Nobility, and promiſed great advantages to the Commons, he ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound them to him, that he procured himſelf to be Proclaimed King, beginning his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1065; and according to his promiſe he remitted to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple many grievous Taxes, making them everywhere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61951:152"/> as fearing a ſtorm from the <hi>Norman Coaſt,</hi> which ſoon after happened, to his deſtruction; the cauſe of it being reported by Hiſtorians three ſeveral ways,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Edward</hi> had conſigned his <hi>Crown</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Seventh Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to be holden by him after his Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Young <hi>Edgar,</hi> the true Heir, to whom he was great Unkle, had reſigned his Right to him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too weak to contend for the poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Harrold</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> life-time Hawking on the Coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the <hi>Hawk</hi> when he was caſt off flew into the Sea; whereupon getting into a Skiff in hopes to recover him, a Storm aroſe, and he was driven on the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy;</hi> where Landing, and being taken Priſoner, he was known and preſented to the Duke, who cauſed him to be kept with a ſtrict Guard, till ſuch time as he Swore, That if King <hi>Edward</hi> Dyed Iſſueleſs, he would do his utmoſt endeavour to ſecure the Kingdom to the uſe and behoof of him the before named Duke; and thereupon he procuring his Liberty, returned to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However having got the <hi>Crown</hi> on his Head, he held it too precious a Jewel ſo lightly to part withal; ſo that when the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> ſent to demand it, putting him in mind of his Oaths and Promiſes, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>That what was extorted from him in his extremity was not Binding; beſides, the Nobility and Commonalty of his Realm would not conſent to his delivering it up to a Stranger, as having had ſad Experience of the great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that had and muſt conſequently again enſue; and finally what he demanded of him was not in his power to grant, and therefore prayed him to reſt ſatisfied with his own Territories, which were ſufficiently large enough for any Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Anſwer made the Duke ſtorm, and reſolve to hazard all, rather than miſs of his aim; whereupon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61951:153"/> ſelling his Jewells and Plate, he Levyed Men in <hi>France, Switzerland, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> And tho' the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtrictly forbid him to moleſt <hi>England,</hi> under pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, he took no regard of his Menaces, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his Shipping, and ſent to <hi>Norway</hi> and thoſe parts from whence the <hi>Normans</hi> originally deſcended, to ſtir them up by Landing in the North, in ſavour of his Invaſion on the South parts of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo in order to it continued his Levys, making a League with the <hi>French</hi> King, That he ſhould not Invade his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in his Abſence. However <hi>Harrold,</hi> having notice of his proceedings, raiſes a great Army, which was not long Idle: For <hi>Toſto,</hi> Brother to <hi>Harrold,</hi> upon ſome diſpleaſure flying to <hi>Denmark,</hi> forwarded the <hi>Norman</hi> Dukes Negotiation, ſo that with a conſiderable Army they Landed at <hi>Richall</hi> upon <hi>Ouſe</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and fell to Burning and Plundering; whereupon the King Marched his Army towards them, who were Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>Stanford Bridge,</hi> built over the River <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rwent;</hi> upon which Bridge he was ſtopped with his whole Army by a Single <hi>Dane</hi> of Monſtrous Size, who ſlew Forty of his Men who adventured to remove him, and had in all likelyhood prevented his paſſing at that time over the Bridge, had not a Souldier Rowed with a Boat under it, and run up his Spear through a creviſe into the <hi>Danes</hi> Body, whereupon he fell down Dead, and the King haſted with his Army over the Bodies of the ſlain and falling upon the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi> made of them an incredible ſlaughter, ſlaying <hi>Toſto</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; Olave</hi> the Son of <hi>Harfager,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> were taken Priſoners, who begging their Lives, were ſuffered to depart with the reſt of the Priſoners, having only 20 of their 300 Ships left, to carry them (with the woful News) into <hi>Denmark,</hi> the reſt being
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61951:153"/> broken on the Rocks by a mighty Storm the day before the Battel happened.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Troubles were no ſooner over, and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts a little ſettled, but News came poſting to the King that Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> was Landed at <hi>Pevenſey</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> on the Eighth of <hi>September, Anno Dom.</hi> 1066, who thereupon cauſed his Ships to be ſet on Fire, that his Souldiers might take Courage to Fight the more deſperately, as having no hopes of returning home unleſs they Conquered; and when he firſt came on Shoar, his Foot ſtuck faſt in the Sand, ſo that he fell on his Hands, and being perceived by a Knight to bring up a handfull of Earth when he riſe, he ſaid <hi>Now Sir Duke,</hi> England <hi>ſticks faſt to you, and is your own, ſince you have taken</hi> Livery <hi>and</hi> Seizen, <hi>doubt not but preſently to be King thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Time King <hi>Harrold</hi> was haſtily returned to <hi>London,</hi> whither the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke ſent a Meſſage to him, to demand a peaceable ſurrender of the Kingdom, for ſparing the lives of the People: But this Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was diſmiſſed with Threats, and both Armies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards each other; and on a fair Plain in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> called (from the enſuing Fight) <hi>Battel-Field,</hi> the <hi>Normans</hi> pitched their Tents, to expect the King, who was about ſeven Miles from them; and ſome of the Spies he ſent, being taken, Duke <hi>William</hi> cauſed them to be carried from Tent to Tent, and plentifully Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; after which, he diſmiſſed them: So the next Morning both Armies came in ſight of each other, and drew up in Battel Array, where a ſecond time the Duke ſent a Monk to the King, to demand a peaceable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Kingdom, or otherwiſe (for avoiding the effuſion of much Blood) to try it by ſingle Combate; or elſe to hold the Kingdom as his Tributary. But <hi>Harrold</hi> would agree to neither of theſe; returning for

               <p>Theſe <hi>Normans,</hi> ſo called from the <hi>Northern Climes</hi> which firſt produced them, were compoſed of <hi>Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Danes;</hi> who finding their Country too ſtraight for them, betook them to the Seas to ſeek their Fortunes, and practiced <hi>Piracies</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Belgia, Frizia,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> on the latter of which they Landed under the Leading of <hi>Rollo</hi> their Duke, and became very troubleſom to the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom there was great Wars: Till at laſt <hi>Rollo</hi> Dreaming <hi>He ſat on the higheſt Hill in</hi> France, <hi>and a pleaſant Spring Iſſued out of a Rock on which he laid his Head, running down in many Streams, to which flocked a number of Birds with Red Breſts, to Drink the Water, and then flew to fragrant Groves, where they Sung ſo Melodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was Raviſhed with their Notes, and beneath this Hill he fancied there lay ſo pleaſant a Country, that the like he had never beheld in his Life.</hi> When Waking much pleaſed with his Dream, he ſent for a <hi>Monk</hi> of <hi>Crowland,</hi> accounted a great Diviner, telling him his Dream, and demanding the Interpretation of it; who willing (for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61951:158"/> his Countrys ſake) to be rid of ſuch troubleſom Gueſts, told him at an adventure, as is ſuppoſed, <hi>That the Fates had Decreed him to ſettle his Dominions in one of the moſt pleaſant Countries of</hi> France. Which he gave creadit to, and perceiving <hi>England</hi> much waſted and impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by a tedious War and a Famine that then raged, having exacted ſome Aides and Supplies of Money, he Tranſported his Forces over the Narrow Sea, and Warred five Years with ſuch Fury on the <hi>French,</hi> that fearing to loſe all, <hi>Charles</hi> their King (Sirnamed the <hi>Simple</hi>) gave him his Daughter <hi>Gilla</hi> in Marriage; and as her Dowry the Peaceable Poſſeſſion of what they had already gained by the Sword, which being model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Dutchy, they called <hi>Normandy,</hi> which Name (through all the changes of that Kingdom) it bears to this day.

                  </head>
                  <p>AFter the Victory obtained at <hi>Battel-Field</hi> by the <hi>Normans</hi> over the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and King <hi>Harrold</hi> Slain, as has been mentioned in the former Chapter, Duke <hi>William</hi> deſigned for <hi>London,</hi> yet taking a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, waſting as he Marched the Counties of <hi>Suſſex, Kent, Surry, Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire;</hi> by whoſe Spoiles he Inriched his <hi>Normans.</hi> Then croſſing the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and ſo in the like manner the Counties of <hi>Oxford, Buckingham, &amp;c.</hi> At <hi>Burhamſted</hi> he made a ſtop; as being aſſured by this time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces were diſperſed, and in no condition to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61951:160"/> oppoſe him; and hither repaired <hi>Aldred</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>York, Wolſtan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter, Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> The Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> with <hi>Edgar Etheling</hi> the True Heir to the Crown, paying Homage and Allegiance to him, and entreating him (ſeeing it was not in their power to prevent it) <hi>That he would take upon him the Adminiſtration of the Government, and be Gracious in his Clemency to the People of</hi> England. And ſo paſſing to <hi>London,</hi> he was on <hi>Chriſtmas-Day, Anno Dom.</hi> 1066 <hi>Crowned</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by <hi>Aldred</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus ſettled in the Throne by the Fortune of a Battel, he ſtudied how to ſecure the Realm more firmly to him, as knowing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubmitted not out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearty good will; whereupon he Fortified the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> laying his claim to the Kingdom by Right of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> as having indeed no other reaſonable one to Pretend to. And to ſecure it, he uſed the following Policy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſeized the chief Offices both of Honour and Profit, and conferred them on his <hi>Normans;</hi> and as a Recompence to ſuch others as had Aided him in the War.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He made the Natives give Hoſtages of the beſt and deareſt eſteem, to ſecure their Fidelities, eſpecially ſuch as were either Honourable or Potent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To leſſen the Authority of the <hi>Clergy</hi> among the People, he barred them of all Temporal Command or Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He cauſed the Natives to be Diſarmed to prevent Inſurrections.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He debared them from frequent and common Meetings, eſpecially in the Night, to prevent their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Conſpiring againſt him for the Recovery of their common Liberty, cauſing a Bell to be Rung in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61951:160"/> every <hi>City, Town,</hi> and <hi>Village,</hi> at Eight in the Evening, whereupon all <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were enjoyned to put out their <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Candle,</hi> and keep within their <hi>Houſes,</hi> under great Penalties; and this was and is yet called <hi>Cover le Feu,</hi> the raking up or out of the <hi>Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. To leſſen the Nobility, he ſent them to his Wars beyond the Seas, not to return without orders; and little or no Praiſe or Reward was given them, though they Valiantly behaved themſelves. The like he did with the Meaner Sort whom he found any ways Active, compelling them from their Wives and Children to Fight Abroad, whilſt they Languiſhed at Home for Food, and found little ſupport.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As a ſtrong curb, he erected <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> in ſundry places, putting <hi>Normans</hi> as Commanders into them; who grievouſly Oppreſſed the People; yet they durſt not openly repine againſt it, becauſe they found there was no Redreſs to be had from the King, but their Complaints were charged upon them as Mutinies, and many Puniſhed who privately Murmured at their hard Uſage; and finding the <hi>Clergy</hi> were the Richeſt, he fell upon them firſt, taking away the Plate and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that had been Conſecrated to <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes;</hi> Alledging <hi>That Thieves, Traitors, and Rebels had Lodged them under their Protection, to defraud him of his Forfeitures, and ſecretly to ſupport themſelves, to raiſe a Rebellion when they ſaw fit opportunity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. He cauſed Laws to be made in the <hi>Norman Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> whereupon (though Ignorant of them) many Tranſgreſſed, who were for the ſmalleſt Offence Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and forced to redeem themſelves to their undoing; Diſallowing the Patents and Grants of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings, and publiſhing them to be meerly void; ſo that by this he raiſed great ſums for Renewing them; and thoſe that could not raiſe Money, the <hi>Normans</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61951:161"/> and other Strangers had their Honours, Truſts, and Eſtates, (held in <hi>Fee of the Crown</hi>) beſtowed on them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He cauſed all the Lands to be viewed, Meaſured, and Taxed at an unuſual value; by which means he got great Wealth; but Impoveriſhed the People, as was chiefly intended by it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He Erected many <hi>Courts of Judicature</hi> for puting in execution his New Laws, and ordered his <hi>Judges</hi> to follow his <hi>Court</hi> upon his Removes; by which means he tired out the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> with Extraordinary Troubles and Exceſſive Charges in the proſecution of their Suits. And to make an eaſie way for more <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> to come over, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Rebel, he layed the <hi>Churches, Towns,</hi> nnd <hi>Villages</hi> next to the Sea Coaſt in <hi>Hampſhire</hi> waſte, for Sixty Miles in circumferance, under pretence of making a New Forreſt for his Pleaſure in Hunting, where (as a Judgment for thoſe Dilapidations, and ruining ſo many Families) <hi>William Rufus,</hi> his Son and Succeſſor, was ſlain, as in his Reign will more at large appear. He Seized likwiſe all the <hi>Forreſts</hi> and <hi>Chaces</hi> of <hi>England</hi> into his hands, and made ſevere Laws againſt thoſe that ſhould kill or diſturbe his Game. Puniſhing them with the loſs of Eyes, Limbs, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He gave Territories and ſpacious Field to his Favorites, who divided them into Farms, for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe, and the reſidue they Leaſed at Yearly Rents to their Servants, thereby creating <hi>Mannors</hi> and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling themſelves the <hi>Lords</hi> of them. He divided the Lands into <hi>Hydes,</hi> every <hi>Hyde</hi> containing 20 <hi>Acres,</hi> Eight of which was a <hi>Knights Fee,</hi> the Tenures which he reſerved were <hi>Knights Service in Capite;</hi> and thoſe that ſo held, were enjoyned to do him Service in his Wars; or to his Perſon, when required, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which, he took Oaths of them in Publick
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61951:161"/> Courts; and by reaſon hereof, he diſpoſed of the Bodies of the <hi>Heirs</hi> in <hi>Marriage,</hi> as he liſted, retained in his Cuſtody and Wardſhip, and converted to his own uſe their whole Inheritance, till they accompliſhed the Age of 21 Years; and by his Example others of great Poſſeſſions did the like; which has in ſome caſes given a bad Example to this day.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I ſhewed you (as in a Map) the Model or Deſcription of a rigorous and ſharp Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Conquering Power;</hi> to which low Ebb of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, it ought to be every Good Mans Wiſh and Prayer, this flouriſhing Kingdom may never ſink again. — But to proceed</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conquerer</hi> thinking now he had ſhackled all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, undertook a Progreſs to view <hi>Dover,</hi> to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Repairing the Caſtle, and Strengthen more than ever the Sea Coaſt, to prevent Invaſions from the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> whither many of the <hi>Engliſh Nobility</hi> were fled; and having but a ſmall number with him for his Guard, coming near <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he was all on a ſuddain Surprized by (as he thought) <hi>a Walking Wood:</hi> For the <hi>Kentiſhmen</hi> having notice of his coming, at the perſwaſion of <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (a ſecond <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> for his Countries wellfare) and <hi>Egleſine</hi> Abbot of St, <hi>Auſtines,</hi> had as ſecretly as they could, made them Weapons, and lay in Ambuſh for him; which he no ſooner entered, but every one cut down a Bough to ſhelter him from preſent diſcovery, burſt out of the Woods on either ſide the ſtraight he was paſſing, and ſurrounded his ſmall Train; but whilſt the King was in ſuſpence what this unuſual thing might ſignifie, they all at once threw down their Boughs and ſtood ready prepared with their Bows, Arrows, and ſuch other Weapons as they had for the Encounter; whereupon the <hi>Arch Biſhop</hi> advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61951:162"/> the <hi>Conquerer</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold, moſt noble King, the Commons of</hi> Kent <hi>Aſſembled to demand a Confirmation of their Antient Rights, Laws, and Liberties; the which if you will Grant them, they are willing to Submit, and become your Obedient Subjects; otherwiſe, in defence of them, they are reſolved to venture their deareſt Blood, and preſently to give you Battel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This unexpected Adventure ſtartled the King, that notwithſtanding his great Courage, a ſurpriſing fear ſeemed viſible in his Countenance; ſo that pauſing a while, he thought it more prudent to yield to Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than hazard (after ſo much expence of Blood and Treaſure) his Life and Kingdom on an uncertain Chance and Nicety: Whereupon he ſigned their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands preſented in Writing, and gave them a Solemn Promiſe to Confirm it to them in a Legal manner; whereupon they threw down their Arms, and Shouted for Joy; ſo that from his Reign to this day, that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Enjoys the Priviledges they held in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> time, exempted from other <hi>Counties,</hi> as alſo thoſe in preceding Reigns.</p>
                  <p>After this, perceiving the Spirits of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not ſo eaſily brought under as he ſuppoſed, and hearing that <hi>Swain</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was preparing for an Invaſion at the Inſtigation of <hi>Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> two of King <hi>Harrolds</hi> Sons, he began to relax in his ſeverity; and to make fair with the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Granted them this ſhort <hi>Charter, viz. I</hi> William <hi>King, Greet</hi> William <hi>Biſhop, and</hi> Godfrey Porters <hi>and all the</hi> Burgeſſes <hi>within</hi> London, French <hi>and</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and I Grant you that I Will that you Maintain and Enjoy all your Laws as you did in the days of King</hi> Edward (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Confeſſor) and I will that each Child be his Fathers Heir; and further I will that no Man Wrong you, and ſo God keep you.</hi>

                  <p>However the <hi>Danes</hi> Landed a ſtrong Army in the North, where they were Joyned by many <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in hopes thereby to regain their Liberties; but the King haſting thither, drove them to their Ships with great ſlaughter; and to revenge him on thoſe that had joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, he waſted the Country from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Durham;</hi> ſo that for Nine Years the Ground lay waſte, which occaſioning a Famine, numbers of People Dyed.</p>
                  <p>After this he Summoned a <hi>Convocation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> charging them with many faults and failures in their Functions, and Duty towards him, for which he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and Deprived divers Learned and Godly Men of their Dignities, Living and Subſtance: The two former he beſtowed on ſuch as bid moſt for them, and the latter he kept to Maintain his Wars in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where Troubles were ariſen in his Abſence; the <hi>French</hi> labouring to recover it, as part of their Antient Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. But ſcarce had he Expelled them ere haſty News recalled him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> had ſet up <hi>Edgar Etheling,</hi> and raiſed great Forces; which were ſo Formidable to the <hi>Conquerer,</hi> by reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were generally enclined to favour the Young Prince, than he found himſelf conſtrained to end the Difference by fair means; and to make the common ſort more ready to embrace it, he Swore to keep Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable the Antient Laws of the Land, particularly thoſe of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> but not long after he took from the <hi>Abby</hi> of St. <hi>Albans</hi> all the Lands between <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>London-Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to Strengthen himſelf he made a League with <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had often publickly, or underhand, made Incurſions, or raiſed Commotions in the Northern parts of the Kingdom. And the Bounds of the Country were aſcertained by rearing a <hi>Stone Croſs,</hi> called by the <hi>Scots Stain Moor,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:61951:164"/> but by the <hi>Engliſh Roy Croſs,</hi> or <hi>Kings Croſs,</hi> and ſoon after the King Sailed again for <hi>Normandy;</hi> and quelled the Rebellious <hi>Normans</hi> that were joyned with the <hi>French</hi> againſt him, and ſo returned with Victory (but his Treaſure being Exhauſted) he to recruit it, Sold to <hi>Walcher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> the <hi>Earldom</hi> of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but he Enjoyed it not long, for Oppreſſing the People to raiſe the Money he had disburſed, they roſe in a Tumultuous manner and ſlew him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1075; and the enſuing Year a Froſt continued without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, from the 12th of <hi>November</hi> to the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> ſo that the Wild Fowl were moſt deſtroyed, and many Cattle periſhed for want of Food: A Blazing Star ſoon after appeared, whereupon great contentions enſued in <hi>Normandy;</hi> for <hi>Robert</hi> the Kings Son, having Ingratiated himſelf into the Favour of the People, raiſed great Forces and in a ſet Battel Wounded his Father in the Arm, threw him from his Horſe, and took it as his Prize, gaining an intire Victory, in which many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles loſt their Lives: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King finding his Army much weakened, was conſtrained to return for <hi>England,</hi> and finding the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> did not much favour him after this Defeat, to lay a curb and awe on them, he rebuilt the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> drawing a Ditch about it to the largneſs as it continues to this day, it being before but of inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Strength, <hi>viz. Anno Dom.</hi> 1078; and ſo a Peace in a ſhort time being concluded between him and his Son <hi>Robert,</hi> the latter being allowed the nominal Title of <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and entirely to poſſeſs it as a Soveraign Prince after his Fathers Death, he came into <hi>England,</hi> and was made General againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who breaking the League waſted the Northern Countries as far as the place then called <hi>Moonkcheſter</hi> to whom he gave an entire Defeat, and in memory of the Victory
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61951:164"/> erected a ſtrong <hi>Caſtle</hi> of Stone, Naming it <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> from which the Town, ſo called, on <hi>Tine,</hi> took its Name.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this ſuch mighty Rains happened, and continued for ſo long a time, that divers Hills were ſo ſoftened into a Quagmire, that they ſunk down and overthrew many <hi>Cots</hi> and ſome <hi>Villages,</hi> making as it were a Level. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church was likewiſe ſet on Fire in <hi>June</hi> following; ſuppoſed to be done by Lightning, and a great part of it conſumed, but ſoon Rebuilded by the Liberal Contributions of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He held a <hi>Synod</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> where ſome <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> were Tranſlated from one place to another; as <hi>Selwy</hi> to <hi>Chicheſter, Credington</hi> to <hi>Exeter, Shirbourn</hi> to <hi>Salisbury, Dorcheſter</hi> unto <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and there being a Contention between the two Arch Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> for Primacy, he undertook to determine the difference, appointing <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Primate</hi> of all <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> only <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that he and his Succeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubordinate to the <hi>Archiepiſcopal See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> taking advantage of the Kings Abſence from <hi>Normandy,</hi> encouraged <hi>Robert</hi> to make himſelf Abſolute Duke, aſſiſting him with Men and Money; whereupon the King was again conſtrained to paſs the Seas with a puiſſant Army, being over-eager in laying waſte the Country; and haraſſing himſelf in War, being over-heated, he fell Sick, and hearing that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould ſay in a Scoffing manner, <hi>He lay a long time in Child-Bed;</hi> he Replied in a rage, <hi>That at his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>priſing or Churching, he would Light ſo many Candles in</hi> France, <hi>as ſhould Inflame the whole Country:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he made his words good, for upon his recovery, inraged that his Enemies had in his Sickneſs taken the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61951:165"/> advantage to waſte his Territories, he ſpoiled all the Weſt parts of <hi>France,</hi> Firing the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Nantz, Meux,</hi> and a great number of Towns and Villages, Inriching with part of the Spoil the <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> which was of his own Founding; moreover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing in his laſt Will his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Regal Ornaments</hi> to it, appointing his Body (when he Dyed) to be Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed therein. And for the Service done in this War, he requited many of his Commanders, who had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized their Vallour, with poſſeſſions in <hi>England,</hi> to hold them of the <hi>Crown;</hi> one of which Grants for the Antiquity and plain manner of Conveyance, exempted from the tediouſneſs now in uſe, I think not amiſs to recite, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>In the laſt Year of this Kings Reign, there was found in the Province called <hi>Roſe</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> a Sepulcher of 14 Foot Long, in which was Buried, with much
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61951:165"/> Treaſure, as the Cuſtom of the Times then were, <hi>Gawen</hi> one of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Knights of his <hi>Round Table,</hi> and Bones therein of an exceeding bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>And now, as all Kings muſt come at laſt to the Grave, the Life of this <hi>Reſtleſs Conquerer</hi> grew to a Period; for going over to Quiet new Troubles in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> he had ſcarcely Accompliſhed it before he fell Sick of a Malignant Feaver at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and after ſome Languiſhings Dyed; and being a corpulent Man, his Belly in a little time Burſt, and the Stench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, none but a few poor <hi>Monks</hi> would come near him; nor was this all; one <hi>Aſcalinus Fitz Arthur,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman, denyed him Burial in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s <hi>Church,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He had Founded it on his Inheritance violently taken away, that it ſtood upon the Floor of his Fathers Houſe, and the Body of no Deſpoiler ſhould be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Earth;</hi> however <hi>Henry</hi> his Fourth Son, giving a Hundred Pound Weight in Silver as a recompence, he was there Interred, but with little or no Ceremony; ſo that he who in his Life time made Nations Tremble, being Dead, was little or nothing regarded.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, was Son to <hi>Robert</hi> the Sixth Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> begotten as is ſaid, on a Beautiful Damſel named <hi>Arlet,</hi> the Daughter of a <hi>Tanner,</hi> in Honour of whom a Town is called by her Name.

                  </head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>William</hi> the Firſt Dyed, his Eldeſt Son <hi>Robert</hi> was in <hi>Germany,</hi> Negotiating his Fathers Affairs, to draw in thoſe Princes to aſſiſt him in making a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous War on the <hi>French,</hi> who were now become ſomewhat Formidable to their Neighbours; ſo that by the favour of his Abſence, the <hi>Conquerers</hi> Laſt Will, the furtherance of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> and <hi>Wolſtane,</hi> two Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prelates who had great Influence over the Commons, and divers of the Nobles, <hi>William</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61951:169"/> from the Redneſs of his Hair or Face, was after many hot debates among the Nobles, Crowned King at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> by <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> on Sunday the 26th of <hi>September Anno Dom.</hi> 1087.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>William</hi> was Younger Brother to <hi>Robert,</hi> but being of a milder Temper, and better affected to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon he had in a manner been bred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and approved by them, <hi>Robert</hi> found himſelf greatly Agreived that he had been put beſide his Right in <hi>England,</hi> tho' the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> was left entirely to him; but the Title of Duke not agreeing with his great Spirit, when he perceived he might have been a King had not loſs of opportunity barr'd it, he reſolved nevertheleſs to tempt Fortune in a tryal for the regaining what was overſlipt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he raiſed a gallant Army, compoſed of his own Subjects and Strangers, Landing them in <hi>England,</hi> with little or no Reſiſtance, not doing any damage to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but being Encamped Commiſſioners were ſent by King <hi>William</hi> to treat with him about an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the preventing the effuſion of Blood, and the Miſeries ſuch a War was likely to bring on both Nations, for being thereby weakened, they might eaſily become a Prey to Forreign Enemies, who watched for ſuch an opportunity to work their ends, both on <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe and other Reaſons for an amicable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Difference, the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke harkened with much mildneſs, ſo that in a ſhort time it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that <hi>Robert</hi> after <hi>Williams</hi> Death ſhould poſſeſs the Kingdom; and to the end his Heirs might not diſturb it, he was debarred from Marriage, as I find it in ſome Hiſtorians; however, certaine it is, he left no Legitimate Iſſue behind him: And in the mean time he was Yearly to pay the ſum of 3000 Marks. And the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61951:169"/> Articles being Signed, the Brothers took a Friendly leave of each other, ſo that through Providence this threatning Storm which filled <hi>England</hi> with many doubts and fears at its approach, blew over without doing any harm.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> had repaſſed the Seas with his Army, the King fearing he might repent him of what he had Agree'd to, ſtrengthened the Sea Ports, and Built ſome <hi>Caſtles</hi> advantagiouſly on the Havens to prevent Landing by ſurprize; but knowing his prime Strength and Aſſurance was in the Love of his Subjects, he began to careſs the Nobles more than he had done, and remitted to the Commons ſeveral grievous Taxes; for upon his coming to the <hi>Crown,</hi> he thought treading in his Fathers ſteps was the beſt Meaſures; but now he found that Mildneſs rather than Rigor was the ſureſt Policy, to keep the Natives of this Iſland firm to his Intereſt; whereupon he reſtored much that had been Extorted by his Rigorous Miniſters; and the better to curry favour with the People, cauſed ſome of them to be puniſhed for the offences he had enjoyned them to commit.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayon,</hi> the Kings Unkle, who had been Baniſhed by the <hi>Conquerer,</hi> came over and was kindly received by his Nephew, who Created him <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> and conferred on him many other Honours and Truſts, which made the old <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> preſume ſo much on the Kings Favour, That he took upon him more Authority to Rule than came to his ſhare by many degrees; whereupon the Nobles made grievous complaints, That a Stranger ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to Domineer over them in their Native Country; ſo that the King being ſenſible of his Arogancy, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Smiles into Frowns, which cauſed him to make a party among the <hi>Engliſh Normans,</hi> and to fall into
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61951:170"/> open Rebellion; Declaring for Duke <hi>Robert</hi> and his Right, who underhand had promiſed to Land ſome Forces, but did not. This Treachery of the <hi>Normans,</hi> made the King almoſt totally throw himſelf on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for Safeguard and Protection.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Fractions and Diſorders in the State, begat new conceits in <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who reſolving to take the advantage of them, haſtily raiſed an Army and Invaded the Northern Marches, waſting all in his way with Fire and Sword: whereupon the King Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all his Courage, not to leave an Enemy at his Back, firſt fell upon the Biſhop, and gave him and his Rebellious Aſſociates a terrible Overthrow; and in the Battel the Biſhop being taken Priſoner, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Abjure the Land. This happening the latter-end of the Second Year of the Kings Reign, the Third no ſooner began but he reſolved to be Revenged on the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had broke their League with him in order to lay hold on the Advantages Clandeſtine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeemed to offer them, and finding them Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Spoiling his Subjects, he ſcarce gave them time to Embattel, ere like a Tempeſt he broke in amongſt them, deſtroying the greater part of their numerous Army, in which fell Twenty of their Nobles, and their King was conſtrained to Acknowledg Subjection to <hi>England,</hi> renew his League upon Oath, and in further confirmation of his Subjection he became a Pentioner to King <hi>William;</hi> and to make it more apparent he was Tributary to <hi>England,</hi> payed Twelve Mark Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Twelve Villages the King reſtored him (after he had taken them from him in this War) which he had held in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerer;</hi> and to Fortifie againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Incurſions he Rebuilded and Gariſoned the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Carliſle</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> it having been demoliſhed by the <hi>Danes</hi> about 200 Years

                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after this, <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> coming to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> where King <hi>William</hi> held his Court, being denied Acceſs, and unhandſomly treated by ſome Carpet-Courtiers who had been raiſed from a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he (without acquainting the King with it, or demanding ſatisfaction for the Indignity put upon him) flung away in a great rage; and arriving in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Aſſembled the Nobles, and incited them to bring all the Forces they could raiſe to his Standard, which they punctually obeyed, and entering <hi>England</hi> with a huge Army, he waſted all before him as far as <hi>Alnewick,</hi> which he Beſieged, and Took it; but the ſtrong Caſtle held out againſt him, which with his numbers he ſo ſtraightly begirt, that Famine got in and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai'd the Beſieged; whereupon an adventurous Knight, with a Flag of Truce in his Hand, and the Keys of the Caſtle on his Spear, came out at the Gate Mounted on a ſwift Racer, and making low obeyſence, as if he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> being come pretty near, ſetting Spurs to his Horſe he run at the King with his Spear, and piercing him into the Eye and Brain, he fell Dead to the Ground, and the Knight by the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Horſe eſcaped through the <hi>Scotiſh Camp;</hi> at which the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo diſmai'd, That they raiſed the Siege, and departed with the Body of their King Mournfully into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this daring piece of Service, which turned ſo much to the advantage of <hi>William,</hi> The Knight had his Name by him changed from <hi>Mabrey</hi> to <hi>Piercey,</hi> and was created Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> whoſe Race as Earls continued till of very late days, as will appear in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61951:172"/> the ſucceeding Reigns. But this Succeſs prevented not a Conſpiracy againſt the King, for <hi>Robert Mowbrey</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Ancho</hi> Plotted to take away his Life by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and Crown <hi>Stephen D' Albemarle</hi> his Second Siſters Son; but the Deſign being Diſcovered a little before it was to be put in practice by one of the Accomplices in the Conſpiracy, ſome were taken and Executed, others Fled.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Welſh</hi> Rebelling under the Leading of <hi>Rees</hi> their Prince, the King with a gallant Army enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wales,</hi> but the Rebells ſhifting from one ſteep Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to another, as well knowing the ways in thoſe Faſtneſſes, and climbing the craggy Clifts, like <hi>Goats,</hi> many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were waſted in purſuing them; but at length Starving them out, they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to a Battel, wherein <hi>Rees</hi> was Slain with moſt of his Army; whereupon <hi>Wales</hi> entirely ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Troubles were ſcarce over, when another Storm threatned from <hi>Normandy:</hi> The Duke ſpurred on by <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who promiſed to Aid him, a ſecond time prepared for <hi>England;</hi> but the King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Army on foot, concluded it better to ſeat the War in another Country than in his own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the Dukes making his Voyage, Sailed to <hi>Normandy,</hi> whoſe ſurpriſing Landing, brought great fear on the Country; however, the King finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able with the Army he had to do no great matters, and being deſtitute of Money to raiſe Forces Abroad, bethought him of a Stratagem to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſent to <hi>England</hi> many chief Officers to Levy ſuch for the Wars as were of Ability, and having Liſted <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and others to the number of 30000, when they came to the Sea Shoar, and moſt of them ſhewed an unwillingneſs to Embark, as looking back to their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61951:172"/> Wives and Children, from which many of them had been forced, upon a pretended preſſing urgency, it was Proclaimed, That ſuch as would lay down Ten Shillings ſhould be Diſcharged from the Service, which moſt of them did with great Alacrity; ſo that very few of them went: With this Money King <hi>William</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand bought off <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King from the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi>'s Intereſt; which he perceiving, agreed with his Brother by Ratifying again the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and the <hi>Chriſtian Armies</hi> being on foot in moſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> to reſcue the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the Tyrany of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sarazens,</hi> Duke <hi>Robert</hi> (to raiſe Forces and accompany them) Pawned his <hi>Dutchey</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> to King <hi>William</hi> for 10000 Pounds; and there did many Valiant Exploits, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he was firſt prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be made King of it, and all the Country lying about it, larger than what either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> poſſeſſed; but he refuſed it, in hopes of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> after his Brothers Death, tho' he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of it and Dyed a deplorable Death, which ſome have accounted as a Judgment for his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the profered Scepter of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> However on his refuſal, the Princes choſe <hi>Godfry</hi> of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with which Choice he Joyfully complied, but would not be <hi>Crowned,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>with a Crown of Gold, where our Bleſſed Saviour for the Sins of Man, and to procure his Redemption, had ſome time worn a Crown of Thorns.</hi> But nearer to My Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The King was no ſooner returned out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but News was brought him the <hi>Welſh</hi> were again in Rebellion; whereupon he Marched to Subdue them, but returned without effecting it, by reaſon of the violent Torrents occaſioned by the Rain, and their keeping among the Rocks and Faſtneſſes, till his Army
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61951:173"/> was tired out with Famine and other inconveniencies; yet ſoon after they grew Quiet of themſelves. But ſcarce had he time to take breath, ere a Rebellion broke out in the North, whither he haſted with his Army, gave the Rebells a great Overthrow, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the Ringleaders cauſed them to be put to Death, but extended his Pardon to the common ſort; and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> who encouraged them, was committed to <hi>Windſor Caſtle,</hi> where he continued a long while Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Welſh</hi> growing again troubleſom, by waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders, and carrying away great ſpoils, the King ſent the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Cheſter</hi> againſt them with a ſtrong Power, where after ſome Search, and as ſecret Marchings as they could, they found them making Merry in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey</hi> with the Plunder they had got from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and falling upon them when they expected nothing leſs, their <hi>Feaſting</hi> was turned into <hi>Mourning;</hi> for the greater part of them was Slain, and thoſe that were taken Priſoners moſtly loſt Feet, Hands, or Eyes, or were put to worſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as a Terror to the reſt, that they ſhould keep Quiet within their appointed limits.</p>
                  <p>The King thinking all would now be Quiet, reſolved to take his Eaſe; and then forgeting how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had faithfully ſtood by him and aſſiſted him in his moſt dangerous undertakings, he caſt many of them out of Favour, Office, and Truſt; laying grievous Taxes on the Commonalty, Selling for ready Money the beſt Promotions in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, Prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Anſelm</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to Aſſemble any <hi>Convocations</hi> or <hi>Synods</hi> (for the well ordering the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or for the Correcting ſuch as did Offend) without his Leave or Licenſe; by which means he ſecretly filled his <hi>Coffers</hi> with <hi>Treaſure;</hi> and tho' the Good Arch
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61951:173"/> Biſhop laid before him the ill conſequences and dangers of ſuch Proceedings, and not being minded, he reſolved to go for <hi>Rome,</hi> and lay before Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Third the danger the <hi>Church</hi> was in, by Miſgovernment, and to perſwade him to Intercede with the King not to intermedle with <hi>Church-Affaires,</hi> but leave them to his <hi>Clergy.</hi> The King hearing of his Intention, ſent to command him not to go; but the Old Man and his Retinue were before on their Journey; however, the King ſent after him, and Pillaged him near <hi>Dover</hi> of all his Wealth, in hopes that would ſtay him, but it did not: For he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that the <hi>Pope</hi> in a chafe would have Excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the <hi>King;</hi> But his <hi>Clergy</hi> Adviſed him that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already Excomunicated the <hi>Emperour Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>The firſt Chriſtian Prince that ever was under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunication,</hi> therefore it would be convenient to ſee the Iſſue of that Sentence, ere he proceeded any further; <hi>For,</hi> ſays a blunt Abbot, <hi>your Holineſs muſt have a care how you heat any more Irons before you ſee how thoſe you have Heated already will be Quenched, leaſt they prove too Hot for your handling.</hi> However many Letters and Verbal Meſſages were ſent to the King, Admoniſhing him not to meddle any more with the Inveſting of Biſhops, by giving them the <hi>Croſs, Ring,</hi> and <hi>Paſtoral Staff,</hi> nor Prohibit the Aſſembling of the <hi>Convocations</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> touching the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor the Execution of any <hi>Canons</hi> tho' they were by Regal Authority Confirmed.</p>
                  <p>To this the King Anſwered <hi>That he would ſtill do as he Pleaſed, and not loſe ſo fair a Flower belonging to his Crown.</hi> And being Reproved in the abſence of <hi>Anſelm,</hi> by <hi>Ralph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> he caſt him into diſgrace, and Suſpended many <hi>Churches</hi> in his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> cauſing the Revenues to be brought into his Exchequer; ſo

                  <p>By theſe ways the King had Amaſſed great Sums, part of which he laid out in Building, <hi>viz.</hi> He made outward Walls and Bullwarks about the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> on this ſide the Ditch, which Ruined by Time and other Accidents are now Demoliſhed tho' ſome of the Ruins yet remain; alſo <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> being 90 Yards Long and 24 Yards and 2 Foot Broad; yet when he ſaw it, he ſaid, <hi>It was too Little by half, and therefore he would reſerve it for a Bed-Chamber;</hi> though indeed it is accounted the Largeſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> and one thing is remarkable, tho' there are many <hi>Cobwebs</hi> in the Windows, and in the Glaſs Lanthorn above the, Roof, yet on the large and curious Wooden Frame, tho' never Swept, not any appear; which has given occaſion to conclude it is made of <hi>Iriſh Oak,</hi> and that the virtue of the Wood is ſuch, no Spider will come near it.</p>
                  <p>The King being thus at Eaſe, the <hi>French</hi> were not wanting to take the Advantage of it, eſpecially ſince Duke <hi>Robert</hi> was abſent, Warring in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and had left his Dukedom in charge with the King of <hi>England,</hi> whereupon they laid Siege to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Conſtantia</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and preſſed it very ſorely; of which King <hi>William</hi> having news as he was in the height of Sport, Hunting in <hi>New Forreſt,</hi> he left all his Company on a ſuddain, and Poſted towards the Sea Side, where finding a ſmall Bark, he leaped into it, and commanded the Maſter to ſet Sail for any part in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61951:174"/> but the Sea running high by reaſon of a Storm, he refuſed to weigh Anchor, laying before the King that the paſſing at that time was full of danger, and therefore intreated him to wait for more favourable Weather; whereupon much enraged, he commanded him to make no delay for any fear or danger of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, <hi>For when</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>have you ever heard a King was Drowned by a Storm?</hi> So that the Marriners plying the beſt of their skill to bear in the Wind, they got ſafely over.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> no ſooner heard the King was Landed, but concluding he had a great Army with him, or ſoon to arrive, were ſo chill'd with fear, that Courage fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; in much diſorder they raiſed the Siege, and the Beſieged in Sallying cut off a great many in the Rear, took moſt of their Tents and Baggage, left behind for haſte; and ſo the King with a ſmall Train coming thither, was joyfully received, and having better Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Stored it with Proviſions, conferring ſome Honours and Gifts on thoſe that behaved themſelves well, he returned to <hi>England,</hi> met divers of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity who had raiſed Forces and were coming to his Aid, who ſcarcely believed he could be there in ſo ſhort a time, or what he related of the raiſing the Siege could be true, till they had it confirmed from many hands.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Year of this Kings Reign, a terrible Earthquake happened; and in the fourth, ſuch prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lightening and Thunder as did great miſchief in divers places, and particularly it Burnt the Steeple of the <hi>Abby</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> rent the Beams of the Roof, and caſt down the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> breaking one of its Leggs as alſo the Crucifix; and not long after, ſo great a Storm happened at <hi>London,</hi> that it blew down 60 (ſome ſay 606) Houſes, and took off the Roof of <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> bearing it a great height in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61951:175"/> Air, and ſix of the Beams, being 27 Foot Long, with the fall run a prodigious depth into the Ground, the Streets being then un-paved, ſo that with much labour they were digg'd out. In his ſixth Year was ſo great a Scarcity of Proviſions, and a Peſtilence, that in Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Places the Living were hardly ſufficient to Bury the Dead. In his ninth Year two Blazing Stars with long Firey Trains appeared, one in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the other in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> for twenty Nights, ſeeming to dart Fire one at the other. And in the laſt Year of his Reign the Sea overflowed its Banks in <hi>Kent,</hi> and lay'd under Water all the Lands that had been Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 4000 Acres, Drowning much People and Cattel, and Demoliſhing many Villages. And to this day has not been Regained.

                  <p>Theſe Nuptials were no ſooner conſummated, and a firm League made with <hi>Scotland,</hi> but Duke <hi>Robert</hi> Landed his Army at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> which put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into apprehenſions of being involved in a doubtful War; but this threatening ſtorm was ſoon blown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the diſcreet mediation and counſel of Friends on both ſides; ſo that a friendly Peace enſued between the two Brothers, upon ſuch like Conditions as had been Agreed on in <hi>William Rufus</hi>'s Days; whereat the <hi>Norman</hi> Lords were much diſpleaſed, and returned diſcontented with the Duke; ſo that the King fearing he would not long reſt contented with the Agreement, reſolved to be beforehand with him; and therefore raiſing a gallant Army he Sailed to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and was joyned by many of the diſcontented Nobles, giving the Duke two great Overthrows: After which, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner forſaken, ſhifted from place to place; when in the mean while the King preſſing his good

                  <p>In the Sixth Year of this Kings Reign, the Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> being accompanied by her Brother-in-Law, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Landed in <hi>England</hi> with an Army, which as it Marched was much encreaſed by the comming in of many <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſoon after joyned by <hi>Randulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with a Body of <hi>Welſh;</hi> hereupon the King, repoſing no confidence in delay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Experience adviſing him that time would be the chief enabler of his Adverſaries Succeſs, he Levied a ſtrong Army, and Marched againſt them, ſo that a cruel Fight, with equal hopes, was Fought for many hours between them; but at length the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on the Kings part, ſtriving faintly, rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave, themſelves, than to defend their Prince, they at laſt betook them to Flight, and left him with a few Nobles and Gentry; yet with his Battel-Ax in his Hand, like an enraged Lion, he ſtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Combate, Slaying many of the Enemy; till at laſt, being ſurrounded, and in vain demanded to yeild, he made a War himſelf againſt whole Troops,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61951:191"/> till being beaten down with a weighty Stone caſt on him at a diſtance, he was taken Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Briſtol Caſtle;</hi> where remaining about three Months, he was exchanged for the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who in the mean while was made a Priſoner to King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Queen. However after this Battel, <hi>Maud</hi> received the Allegiance of all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Kent;</hi> and Marching to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> received there the <hi>Crown</hi> and other <hi>Regalia's,</hi> and ſo paſſing to <hi>London,</hi> ſhe was received in Triumph; and now the reports of King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Defeat and Impriſonment, flying into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> cauſed his Subjects there to ſlight him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to <hi>Geoffery,</hi> Husband to the Empreſs; but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Minds, when they heard the King was at Liberty, and had ſtrongly Beſieged the Empreſs in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> whither ſhe was Fled, upon notice the <hi>Londoners</hi> conſulted to ſeiz her, and deliver her Priſoner to the King, becauſe ſhe had refuſed to confirm to them King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, with all their Charters and Priveledges. And withdrawing privately from <hi>London,</hi> for fear of a Surprize, ſhe poſted to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where ſhe had not been ſcarce five Days, ere the King Beleagured the <hi>City,</hi> and preſſed it with continual Aſſaults, tho' in the depth of Winter; ſo that the Empreſs fearing to be Taken, dreſſed herſelf in White, and paſſing the <hi>Thames</hi> on the Ice, went through the Snow, which lay then thick on the Ground, to <hi>Abingdon,</hi> where taking Horſe, ſhe paſſed to <hi>Wallingford-Caſtle,</hi> kept with a ſtrong Gariſon by her Friends; and by this time her Brother and Son <hi>Henry</hi> were Landed at <hi>Warram-Haven,</hi> and from thence came to her with ſome Forces; but ſhe wearied with the various turns and chances of War, ſoon after left <hi>England,</hi> and returned to her Husband who was in <hi>Normandy,</hi> having ſent Prince <hi>Henry</hi> before; and ſo <hi>Oxford</hi> being Surrendered to the King, he went
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61951:192"/> to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Summoned the Barons, who there Swore Allegiance to <hi>Euſtace</hi> his Son, whom he Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Duke of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> refuſing to <hi>Conſecrate</hi> him, was obliged, for his contempt of the Kings commands, to leave the Land, and fly to <hi>Normandy;</hi> whereupon the King ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Temporalities, but did not diſpoſe of the Arch Biſhoprick.

                     <l>His Reign proves Stormy, and he Childleſs falls.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Kings Treaſure being much waſted in the Wars he Fought, he demanded a Subſidy of the Clergy; but they refuſing it, he was extream angry with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, demanding of the Biſhops of <hi>Salisbury, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> the Keys of their Caſtles, and exacted great Sums of Money from them, pretending they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Crown for the Tenures of their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities.</p>
                  <p>And now Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> being grown up gathered an Army, and Invaded <hi>England;</hi> nor was the King ſlow to Oppoſe him, but was ſomewhat retarded by the Indiſpoſition of his Son, who fell into a Frenzy, of which he ſhortly Dyed, greatly lamented of the King, who had no more Children; but Sorrow giving place to Anger, he cauſed the Trumpets to ſound a Charge againſt the Enemy; but as the two Armies were about to joyn, ſuch a Storm of Rain and Hail fell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long that they were forced out of the Field to ſeek ſhelter; which gave a time for Parly; and the King weary of the War, and pittying the Sufferings of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61951:192"/> his People, being Childleſs, and not expecting any more Children; after many Meſſages from one to the other, a meeting was appointed; in which it was firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed, That the King ſhould Adopt Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his Heir, to Succeed him in the Kingdom and other his Dominions; and in lieu thereof, he ſhould quietly enjoy the <hi>Crown</hi> during the Term of his Natural Life; which being Signed and Sworn to, all Hoſtilities ceaſed, and <hi>Henry</hi> was ſent to ſuppreſs the Rebellion in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and oppoſe the intruding <hi>French,</hi> where in his Young Years he ſhewed himſelf an expert General and Souldier, in driving the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> out of the Garriſons, and Caſtles they had taken; but whilſt he was buſied in the Wars Abroad, King <hi>Stephen</hi> fell Sick of the <hi>Iliack Paſſion,</hi> and Dyed in the Monaſtery of Monks at <hi>Dover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Stephen</hi> was King of <hi>England</hi> and Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> the third Son of <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Bloyce</hi> by <hi>Adilicia,</hi> or <hi>Alice.</hi> He began his Reign on <hi>Monday</hi> the Second of <hi>December, Anno Dom.</hi> 1135, and Reigned 18 Years, 10 Months, and 20 Days; being the 24th Sole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>England.</hi> He was Buried at <hi>Feverſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> in an Abby of his own Founding.</p>
                  <p>In his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1136, a Fire began at <hi>London-Stone,</hi> and conſumed all before it thence <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> as far as <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and <hi>Weſtward</hi> to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church;</hi> and the next Year <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was deſtroyed by Fire: And in the Third Year of his Reign St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> without the Walls, and the Hoſpital, with Thirty Nine Houſes, and much Riches, were Burnt.

                  <p>He Exiled many of the Nobles, who contrary to their Duties had adhered to King <hi>Stephen;</hi> and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much from the Opinion of his Predeceſſor, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that ſtrong Caſtles and Forts, maintained in the heart of the Kingdom, did rather Animate Great Men, upon any diſpleaſure to Revolt, than Fear them into Obedience; whereupon he cauſed moſt of them to be Razed to the Ground, and Seized ſuch Mannors, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Poſſeſſions, as his Predeceſſors had either Sold or Given from the Crown, holding it to be the Duty of every Subject to refuſe the Gift or Purchace of ſuch things as do immediately concern the Honour and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61951:196"/> Maintenance of a King. And the like he did in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, where many Great Men Commanding as they liſt, had wrought themſelves and their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into many Honours, Caſtles, Mannors, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertained to the Crown. He likewiſe took into his hands the Provinces of <hi>Cumberland, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and the Earldom of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, had received as a Gift from King <hi>Stephen,</hi> to favour his Wars againſt the Empreſs. However the King entered into Amity with <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the ſame Conditions as were Agreed on in <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſts time; and in Token of his Subjection, the <hi>Scot</hi> Offered his Bonnet and Saddle upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Altar at <hi>York:</hi> And about this time, <hi>Theobald</hi> Dying, <hi>Becket</hi> was made Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This King, even in time of Peace, had generally an Army on foot, and rarely kept them Idle; but would often Tranſport them to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and there having Exerciſed them, would bring them back again, ſo that on all occaſions they were found ready and expert Souldiers. And now an advantage opened a way to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland:</hi> For the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part along the Sea being poſſeſſed by <hi>Dormat-Mac-Mahur</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> his Cruelties had highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed his Subjects againſt him, eſpecially upon taking away the Queen of <hi>Morice,</hi> King of <hi>Meath;</hi> ſo that the Injured King Confederating with <hi>Roderick O Conor</hi> King of <hi>Connought,</hi> they beat him out of his Country; ſo that he fled for <hi>England,</hi> and craved Aid of King <hi>Henry</hi> to Reſtore him; which upon taking an Oath of Fidelity and Subjection, was harkened to; when the better to encourage the deſign, the King for a Sum of Money obtained leave of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> then advanced to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61951:197"/> he might Conquer <hi>Ireland;</hi> promiſing moreover throughly to Eſtabliſh the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> therein, and bring it to an acknowledgment of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> but whilſt he was preparing for this Expedition; new Troubles aroſe in <hi>Normandy</hi> which required his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to pacifie; but he granted his Letters Patents, by which he gave leave, with Encouragement, to his Nobles and ſuch others as were willing, to go for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dormat,</hi> impatient of Exile, laid hold of this firſt Advantage, and Solicited the Nobles, but above all, he promiſed <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings Son, a Young Prince of a Warlike Spirit, his Daughter, a very Beautiful Young Lady, and all his Countries after his Deceaſe to be made over to them; he likewiſe incited one <hi>Fitz Stephens,</hi> who with a Band of Valiant <hi>Welſhmen</hi> was the firſt that Landed, and maintained his Ground with much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, till the Prince and divers Nobles came over; and with little trouble they ſeized the Town of <hi>Wexford,</hi> which was given to <hi>Fitz Stephens,</hi> for his part of the Charge of the War; and ſoon after many of the petty <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings being Overthrown, <hi>Dormat</hi> was Reſtored, and <hi>Dublin</hi> the chief <hi>City,</hi> Submitting to him, he put to Death, by many Cruelties, ſuch of his Capital Enemies as he found there.</p>
                  <p>However the Prince went Conquering on, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all before him; of which King <hi>Henry</hi> had no ſooner Notice, but fearing this might fluſh Ambition, and make him practice with his own Subjects for the Crown, he ſpeedily returned to <hi>England,</hi> and ſent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates Commanding all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to return; rallying the Nobility, for ſuffering the Prince in his Abſence to go over; he was in this ſo far Obeyed, that the Prince was left in <hi>Dublin</hi> with a ſmall Train; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was not ſlow in taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61951:197"/> of this Retreat, and therefore Beſieged him in that prime City with an Army of 30000 Men; upon which he Sally'd with about 1500, and utterly Routed them, taking great Spoils; and ſo in obedience to the Kings commands, returned for <hi>England,</hi> where he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered into his Fathers hands all the Forts and Cities he had taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1172 the King Landed in <hi>Ireland</hi> with a Royal Army, and found <hi>Dormar</hi> to be Dead; however he brought ſuch a Terror on the Country, That <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and moſt of the other Princes ſubmitted to him, intreating him to take the Government on him, as their Supream Lord; which he Accepted, with their Oaths of Fealty, and at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> he made a Royal Feaſt in the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Petty Kings, and moſt of the Nobility of the Kingdom; and having ſettled the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical matters, reforming Barbarities and Abuſes, he brought thoſe that held out in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> under Subjection; and ſo returned in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Ireland</hi> made ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and has ſo continued ever ſince, being a very ſpacious Country, <hi>viz.</hi> in Length 303 Miles, in Breadth 112, in Circumference 948. And ſuch was the over-fondneſs of this King to his Eldeſt Son, <hi>Henry,</hi> that he cauſed him and his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, to be twice ſollemnly Crowned in the preſence of his People, himſelf (the ſecond time, for that day) leaving the Title of King, and ſerving as a Servitor at his Son's Table; whereat the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> whiſpering the Young <hi>Henry</hi> in the Ear, ſaid, <hi>Never any King of</hi> England <hi>had ſuch a Sewer at his Table: Nay,</hi> replied the Upſtart, <hi>my Father need not think it any diſhonour to him, as being but Royal Born on one ſide, when I had both a King to my Father, and a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61951:198"/> Queen to my Mother;</hi> upon this the old King ſhook his Head, and whiſpered the Biſhop, <hi>I find, my Lord, I have raiſed the Young Man too ſoon, and too late repent of it:</hi> And from that time he laboured to ſuppreſs the Pride of his Sons, which made them often Rebel and Conſpire with his Enemies, drawing away the Hearts of many of his Subjects: And altho' at one time <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Henry, Geoffry</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> three of his Sons, joyned with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> againſt him; yet by plain Valour he Routed them, and made his Sons, and others that were his Subjects, ſubmit to his Pardon; and ſoon after his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Dyed, in the flower of his Age.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were not all the Kings Troubles, for he was grievouſly peſtered with the ſtubbornneſs of <hi>Becket,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> For upon his firſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to that See, he refuſed to take the Oath for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Articles adminiſtred to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which the reſt of the Biſhops had done, becauſe it was clearly againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority; and perceiving the King much diſpleaſed at his refuſal, he reſolved to ſet the <hi>Pope</hi> on his Back; and therefore privately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he made grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaints againſt the King and Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Second; upon which the <hi>Pope</hi> gave him the <hi>Pall,</hi> and appointed him <hi>Legate;</hi> ſo upon his return, he delivered up his <hi>Chancelorſhip</hi> and <hi>Great Seal,</hi> not giving the King, or any other, an account why he did ſo.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Jars between the King and the Arch Biſhop, imboldened the <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi> to commit many Irregularities, for which they received but ſmall pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; for if they committed <hi>Murthers, Manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Fellonies</hi> or <hi>Robberie,</hi> being Cenſured by Men of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61951:198"/> their own Profeſſion, they came off as they could wiſh; ſo that the <hi>Common Wealth</hi> being ſorely oppreſſed, to Redreſs theſe Grievances, the King found himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to call a <hi>Parliament:</hi> In which that Law made in King <hi>Stephens</hi> Reign, which exempted the Authority of Temporal Judges from meddling with Eccleſiaſtical Affaires, was Repealed; and the Laws held in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, and other the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, Eſtabliſhed and Inforced, being commonly called <hi>Avitae Legis;</hi> but he was ſtoutly oppoſed in his Proceedings by <hi>Becket</hi> and ſome other Biſhops, who unadviſedly made themſelves partakers of his Faction; but after many Conferences, Diſputes and Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all (except <hi>Becket</hi>) Ratified and Subſcribed thoſe newly revived Laws; but he by no means would do it, unleſs he might enter this Clauſe, [<hi>Salvo Ordine ſuo</hi>] which words clearly Annihilated the Life and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe Laws; but the Biſhops fearing the Kings Anger might turn to their great diſadvantage, at laſt prevailed with <hi>Becket</hi> to Swear to the ſaid Laws; but upon another Pet taken, he recanted his Oath, and was Abſolved by the <hi>Pope:</hi> Yet it nothing daunted the King, but rather Irritated him to Seiz into his own hands all ſuch Temporalities as he had formerly given to the Arch Biſhop, requiring him to render an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of 30000 Marks he had Imbezilled during his being <hi>Chancellor.</hi> But the Prelate in Anſwer to this, boldly affirmed the King had freely given it to him as a free Gift, and ought not in Honour or Conſcience to demand it back. Whereupon all the Moveables that appertained to him, were Seized by the Kings expreſs command. At which <hi>Becket</hi> being diſguſted, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> without the Kings Licenſe; and the King perceiving his drift was to incenſe the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt him, ſent his Ambaſſadors to repreſent his perverſneſs, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61951:199"/> evil carriage, and how reaſonable things were, he had impoſed on him; entreating the <hi>Pope</hi> to diveſt him of his Dignity, and he would provide for him and his in another ſtation. But <hi>Becket</hi> had made ſuch intereſt in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> not only refuſed it, but with many Threatnings ſent two <hi>Legates To Curſe the King and all his People,</hi> unleſs on their demands <hi>Becket</hi> were immediatly reſtored to his Dignity, alſo to his Lands and Moveables that were Confiſcated; and in the mean while he commended him to the Abbot of <hi>Pontynack,</hi> where he was kindly received, and for a time entertained. But upon the Kings Threats, that unleſs he was Expelled the Houſe, that he would leave no Monk of that Order in <hi>France,</hi> he was diſmiſſed; the King Commanding, That without his Licenſe no <hi>Cardinal</hi> nor <hi>Legate</hi> ſhould preſume to ſet Footing in <hi>England,</hi> and hereupon he Baniſhed all <hi>Beckets</hi> Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which much grieved him, yet under-hand he was encouraged, by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, reſolutely to perſiſt in his Obſtinacy; whereupon King <hi>Henry,</hi> to put an end to this difference that much diſturbed the Kingdom, Sailed to <hi>France,</hi> and in the <hi>French Kings</hi> preſence, Conferred with the Arch Biſhop, making him an Offer, That if he would take the Oath again, and ſubſcribe the Inſtrument <hi>Triparte,</hi> as himſelf and the Arch Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> had done, he ſhould be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Favour, and enjoy all that was formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to him, and his Friends recalled from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but then he ſtarted another obſtacle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to do it, if it might be with an exception of <hi>[ſalvo honore Dei.]</hi> This more angered the King than the former, for by it he ſeemed to Object the Laws made tended to the diſhonour of God; and if ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently were void in themſelves, bringing a ſcandal upon thoſe that firſt Inſtituted them, and alſo upon
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61951:199"/> himſelf and the Parliament that had Revived them. Whereupon <hi>Becket</hi> plainly told him, <hi>That he feared none but God; and ſince his Laws were derogatory to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtoms and Priviledges of the Church, and Robbed God of his Honour, the King, in ſeeking to Eſtabliſh them, ſhould not have his will whilſt he lived.</hi> And upon this Diſagreement, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſent two <hi>Legates</hi> to Interdict the Kingdom, till <hi>Becket</hi> ſhould be reſtored to his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This ſo far tranſported the King with Anger, (being then in <hi>Normandy</hi>) That he let ſome words fall in his Paſſion, which being taken hold on by ſome of his Courtiers, who miſ-conſtrued the Kings meaning, it proved the deſtruction of <hi>Becket:</hi> For ſoon after having leave to return, and beginning new Troubles in Church Matters, four of them Slew him at the High Altar in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and with him two or three Monks that endeavoured his Reſcue. Thus fell this troubleſom Prelate, who riſing from a low degree, his Father being a <hi>Londoner,</hi> and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Sarazen,</hi> in his Pride contended many Years with a Potent King, and brought many miſeries on the Kingdom. Afterward he was Sainted, and many Superſtitious People went on Pilgrimage to his Tomb.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> no ſooner knew his Champion was fallen, but he Threatned, Curſed and Fulminated, yet with little Terrour. However, to make himſelf Eaſie, the King admitted two <hi>Cardinals</hi> to take his <hi>Purgation,</hi> who allotted his <hi>Penance,</hi> when he had denied his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the Murther upon Oath, to War three Years in the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> (which he Redeemed, by Erecting three Religious Houſes) That he ſhould go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Canterbury</hi> bare Footed to viſit <hi>Beckets</hi> Shrine, which he performed, and ſuffered himſelf to be Scourged by the Monks with Rods on his Naked Back; after which, upon his ſending Preſents to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he was Abſolved.</p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:61951:200"/>
                  <p>During the Kings being thus Abroad his Queen had cauſed <hi>Roſamond</hi> his fair Concubine to be Poiſoned; which ſo inraged him, that he caſt her into Priſon, and would be prevailed on by no Intreaty nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to releaſe her during his Life, tho' ſhe endured many Miſeries and Hardſhips in her confinement; till at length ſhe was ſet at Liberty by her Son <hi>Richard</hi>'s comming to the Crown, as will more at large appear in his Reign.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Gilbert Folliott</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> however hardly the <hi>Pope</hi> had uſed the King, nevertheleſs perſwaded him to regulate abuſes in the Clergy, and curb their Pride; ſhewing him a warrant for it from the Word of God, and the Writings of Eminent Fathers of the Church, and other Good and Learned Men, That for as much as Kings are ſtiled <hi>The Nurſing Fathers of the Church:</hi> It is their Duty to God to ſee it well Ordered and Governed, and like a careful Husbandman ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and keep under thoſe rank Weeds of Error that would over-top and choak the Corn of Truth: He uſed many other Reaſons and Arguments, ſo that the King began to aſſume his Power and look more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into their Covetouſneſs, Pride, and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they laid on ſuch as their Juriſdiction exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over in Temporalities; wherein he abridged and cut them ſhort, which made them greivouſly complain that the King hearkened to Perſons evilly affected to the Church; and the <hi>Pope</hi> having notice, who had adviſed the King, ſent many Threats and Menaces of what Miſchief he would do in <hi>England,</hi> if he did not put him out of his Protection; which he had no ſooner done, but the Clergy, like ſo many Harpies, grievouſly Perſecuted him, till they made him Abjure the Land; but this being contrary to the Kings pleaſure, he was afterward recalled, and had leave to live a private
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61951:200"/> Life. However the King neglected to pay the Tribute called <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Garriſoned his Towns in <hi>Normandy</hi> very ſtrongly, beating out the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French,</hi> and Enlarging his Borders, tho' his Sons proved ſtill troubleſom to him, in under-hand ſiding with the <hi>French,</hi> and ſome diſcontented <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> However he ſurmounted all Difficulties, till in <hi>Normandy</hi> he fell Sick, of a Feaver and Dyed at <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> on the Sixth of <hi>July, Anno Dom.</hi> 1189, when he had Reigned 34 Years, 8 Months, and 11 Days. He was Eldeſt Son to <hi>Geoffery Plantagenet,</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Son to <hi>Foulk</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, Eldeſt Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt. He began his Reign <hi>October</hi> 25, <hi>Anno</hi> 1154; and Dying (as is ſaid) was Buried at <hi>Font-Everard</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is accounted a Wiſe, Juſt, Learned and Valliant Prince; and tho' he little burthened his Subjects with Taxes, conſidering the Wars he had, yet he left in his Treaſury 900000 Pounds in Coin and Plate, beſides Jewels and other things of great value, which furniſhed out his Son <hi>Richard</hi> for the <hi>Holy War.</hi> As for his fair Concubine, whom he entirely doted on, he cauſed her to be Buried at <hi>Godſtow,</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> and on her ſtately Monument placed this Epitaph.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61951:201"/> found here no better Entertainment, for being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Heriticks</hi> by a Convocation of Biſhops at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the King ſtrictly Prohibited his Subjects to relieve them, ſo that wandering up and down, they Dyed with Hunger.

                  <head>The Reign of King <hi>RICHARD</hi> the Firſt.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RICHARD,</hi> the Eldeſt Son living of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, was in <hi>Normanay</hi> at the time his Father Dyed there, and could not come over ſo ſoon as was expected, by reaſon that Country remained unſettled by Inteſtine Wars, and ſome Factions the <hi>French</hi> had made at a great Expence, to keep it ſo; which requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſarily his preſence. However he ſent over ſpeedy orders for the Releaſment of Queen <hi>Elianor</hi> his Mother, who had endured a long and hard Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the ſtrict command of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who would not forgive her at his Death, becauſe ſhe had Poiſoned <hi>Roſamond,</hi> his fair and much beloved Concubine; and after her Releaſment ſhe was by King <hi>Richard</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Regent of <hi>England</hi> till his Return. And then, by reaſon her own Experience had informed her what
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61951:204"/> hardſhips thoſe endured who Languiſhed under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, ſhe cauſed to be ſet at Liberty all ſuch as were in Priſon for ordinary Offences, or ſmall Debts. The latter ſhe Paid, that the Subjects ſhould be no Looſers by her commiſeration, and Adminiſtred the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Prudently, with much Moderation, Integrity and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The King at length coming over with a ſplendid Train of Nobility, was received with great Joy of the People, and puting an end to the Queen Dowager's Regency, was Crowned by <hi>Baldwin</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Swore to keep ſeveral Articles admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to him by the Nobles, to the Eaſe and great Advantage of his Subjects, freeing all that were in Priſon for Offences againſt the Crown, and ſuch others as (without injuſtice done to his Subjects) he could acquit; and in the whole courſe of his Government ſo provided, that Mercy with Juſtice might extend to all; and finding his Brother <hi>John</hi> of a Turbulent Spirit, he heaped many Honours and Promotions on him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſatisfie him, and alay his thirſt of aſpiring; <hi>viz.</hi> He Created him Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and gave him the Counties of <hi>Notingham, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Married him to the ſole Daughter and Heireſs of the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> by which means he obtained the Lordſhip of that County.</p>
                  <p>But theſe great Favours and Donations anſwered not the Kings expectations, for when he had ſhowered on him ſuch Bounties, he found him by his practices reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Crown, as much relying on a Faction at home, and the promiſes of the <hi>French</hi> to aſſiſt him, when need required it: It being a Policy of theirs to divert King <hi>Richard,</hi> (whom all Hiſtorians allow to be a Valiant and Warlike Prince) from Warring on <hi>France,</hi> in Reparation of the many Injuries his Subjects
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61951:205"/> in <hi>Normandy</hi> had Suſtained by the Inroads they had frequently made. However, the King mildly reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Brother, and ſhewing him his Ingratitude, to nurture ſuch Deſigns, alſo the Guilt and Danger he would incur, he made many Excuſes and Proteſtations he had no ſuch Deſigns as had been ſuggeſted of him, and they were both his and the Kings Enemies who had ſpread thoſe reports to ſet them at variance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and his renewed Proteſtations of Loyalty and Obedience, reſolving to live quiet, and contribute all he could to the Advantage of the Commonweal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the King to accept of his Submiſſion, and have a good opinion of his Fidelity; and the King, as an Expiation for the Offences himſelf had committed againſt <hi>Henry</hi> his Father, making a Vow to accompany the other Chriſtian Princes for the Recovery of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and other Infidels, who grievouſly Oppreſſed the <hi>Aſian Chriſtians,</hi> he the more eaſily winked at what he had plainly ſeen; ſo that a Reconcilement being made, the Kings thoughts were wholly taken up with his intended Expedition; but having Laviſhed away the vaſt Treaſure his Father left in large Donations, he found Money was wanting to furniſh him out with ſuch an Army and Equipage as might ſtand with his Honour. He had been Solicited, beſides his own Inclinations, by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, with many promiſed Bleſſings, (as others had been) if by their Arms they Regained the Holy City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Infidels; yet to raiſe Money he refuſed to Levy any Taxes on his Subjects, but Sold his Caſtles of <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Roxborough</hi> to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> for 10000 Pounds; the Lordſhip and Earldom of <hi>Durham</hi> to <hi>Hugh,</hi> then Biſhop of the See, for 16000 Pounds, as alſo Honours, Lordſhips, Mannors, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Royalties and Crown-Lands upon other Grants
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61951:205"/> and Tenures, to divers of his Subjects for much Money; ſo that having, as he ſuppoſed, a ſufficient Treaſure, he prepared things in a readineſs; but contrary to his expectation, it falling ſhort, he borrowed Sums of ſuch as he had formerly Liberally beſtowed his Bounties on, proteſting that for the performing ſo great and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a ſervice, he was not unwilling to Sell his <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> if he could find any body of Ability to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, rather than by Taxes he would Oppreſs his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>In this Undertaking, at the Inſtance and earneſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of the <hi>Pope,</hi> were alſo Engaged <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperer, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, Sirnamed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> King of <hi>France, Leopold</hi> Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes; ſo that a gallant Army was prepared, and great ſtore of Treaſure. With theſe King <hi>Richard</hi> entered into an Agreement that their General Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous ſhould be in the Iſland of <hi>Sicily</hi> the following Spring, and <hi>That ſuch Wealth and Booty as God and good Fortune ſhould put into their Poſſeſſion ſhould be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between them and their Forces;</hi> and thus every thing being in a readineſs, King <hi>Richard</hi> appointed <hi>William Langchamp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Regent, in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and ſoon after, the better to Eſtabliſh the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Authority among the Nobles, who little approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, the <hi>Pope</hi> appointed him his <hi>Legate</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and ſo early in the Spring, the King with about 30000 Men at Arms, with divers Nobles and Gentlemen, ſet Sail and ſafely arrived in the Port of <hi>Meſſina</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> whither the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome other Princes whoſe Territories lay near, were got before him; and there they renewed their Reſolves not to Return till they had won <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but this fair Sunſhine held not long on the <hi>French Kings</hi> part, for his Army being exceeded by the Gallantry of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he feared
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61951:206"/> they would win from him the Glory of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, which his Flatterers had told him would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound totally to his Honour, and the laſting Fame of the <hi>French</hi> Nation; ſo that clouds of diſcontent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on his Brows, and in a little time he gave free Reins to the former Diſpleaſure, that had been huſhed; for that King <hi>Richard</hi> had rejected his Siſter, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of the King of <hi>Navar;</hi> yet as well as he could he diſſembled his diſpleaſure, ſeeing the Eyes of all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> were fixed on this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and without the apparent loſs of his Honour, he could not preſently draw back when he was ſo far En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and ſo weighing Anchor, they ſet forward with a fair Gale; but at length a Storm ariſing, the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> was ſeparated from the reſt, and driven on the Coaſt of the pleaſant Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where ſome of his Ships putting in to Repair the Dammage they had received at Sea, divers of their Marriners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Landing were Slain by the King of the Iſland's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and well-wiſher to this Undertaking; this ſo much tranſported King <hi>Richard</hi> with a deſire of chaſtizing ſuch Inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Outrage, that he Tack'd with his whole Fleet, Landed his Army on the Iſland, and eaſily Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the King and took him Priſoner, carrying him along with him Manacled in Silver Chaines to <hi>Syria;</hi> and having ſecured the Iſland to his Intereſt, by leaving a Governour and Gariſons in the ſtrong Forts, he Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> which place he had News the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had Beſieged, and there was Joyfully received by many of the Princes in Leagre; and having a day or two refreſhed and comforted his Forces, it was agreed that a general Aſſault ſhould be given at the places where the Battering Rams and other forcible Engins had made Breaches in the Walls; which was ſo hotly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61951:206"/> on, that all their Out-works were won in a few Hours; whereupon the Gariſon, not expecting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Relief, and fearing to be put to the Sword, if the Town was taken by Storm, Surrendered upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they might ſafely depart thence: This was agreed to upon their leaving 5000 Hoſtages till a great Sum of Money ſhould be Paid, and that <hi>Saladine</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh Sultan,</hi> ſhould deliver up ſuch Priſoners as he had taken being <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſo about 50000 Marched out, many of them almoſt Starved, the Famine having been extream among them.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner they had vacated the City, but the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi>'s Standard bearer haſted to plant his Maſters Colours on the Battelment, <hi>as if by the ſole Valour of the</hi> Auſtrian <hi>Arms the Place had been Taken;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had the leaſt ſhare in the Danger: This ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed King <hi>Richard,</hi> that not ſtaying to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any other to do it, he ſtept on the Wall, and plucking down thoſe Proud Colours, trampled them under his Feet: This put the Duke into a great chafe, which made him afterward Confederate with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Second, to hinder the progreſs of Affairs in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> that King <hi>Richard</hi> might not carry from them the Glory: Yet he little regarded their Anger, but purſuing this ſucceſs, gave <hi>Saladine</hi> Battel not far from this City, and Overthrew him with incredible Slaughter, having the execution of the Enemy for many Miles, ſo that the Fields and Lanes were covered with their dead Bodies; and thereupon he Marched his Army towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being choſen General by the <hi>Knights Templars</hi> and moſt of the Princes. But in the mideſt of theſe great Deſigns, Mallice thruſt in to hinder the progreſs of the Chriſtian Arms, as to what was intended to be done, for the Diſcontents of <hi>Lewis</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> more and more growing on
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61951:207"/> them, they at length ſhewed it ſo openly as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw a great part of their Forces from the Army; and the former pretending want of Health, and the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates not agreeing with him, Sailed back to <hi>France,</hi> carrying with him the beſt of his Forces; and tho' be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went he gave his Oath, at the earneſt Requeſt of the <hi>Popes Legate,</hi> that he would not injure King <hi>Richards</hi> Territories neither in <hi>Normandy</hi> nor <hi>England,</hi> yet ſoon after recalling the reſt of his Forces, with them went the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom he had conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his Lieutenant General in <hi>Syria:</hi> He did make War againſt <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſtrove to raiſe diſtractions in <hi>England;</hi> but in the former Attempt he was moſtly worſted, yet at laſt ſwept away ſome ſmall Towns and Caſtles; and in the latter, the Threatnings of the <hi>Popes Curſe</hi> againſt all that ſhould Rebel in <hi>England,</hi> prevented his Intrigues in a great meaſure, though ſome Commotions happened, as you will hear in the ſequel.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding thſe Diſappointments, King <hi>Richard</hi> Wintered his Army in thoſe Towns the <hi>Sultan</hi> had Ruinated in his Retreat, to prevent their falling into the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> Rebuilding and Fortifying thoſe that were moſt commodious, reſolving in the Spring to lay Siege to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but when his Forces were drawn into the Field, he found by Sickneſs, and many that had Deſerted, his Army was ſo waſted that he was not able to undertake it. The <hi>Sultan</hi> fearing ſome ſuch deſign had ſtrongly Gariſoned it with 30000 Men: However the King Marched forward, and took by the way divers Caſtles and Fortreſſes, and 5000 Camels Laden with Riches from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which much Encouraged his Soldiers, as being moſtly diſtributed amongſt them: When one day Marching, a Knight climbing up a high Hill, came haſtily to the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61951:207"/> King, and told him from thence he might have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which inſtead of Joy, drew Tears from his Eyes, when lifting up his Hands he paſſionately ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee let me not See thy Holy City, ſince by the Diſappointments I have met with, I am not able to Deliver it out of the hands of the Enemies of thy Name;</hi> and ſo turning aſide, he returned to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> where he found ſome new Adventurers Arrived, when Marching croſs the Country, and Subduing all before him, he brought ſuch a Terrour upon the People, that his very Name was frightful to them; and as ſome Hiſtorians have it, a long while after uſed to Bugbare their Children with it, when they cry'd and were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward, <hi>viz. If you hold not your peace, King</hi> Richard <hi>is coming, and will have you;</hi> which had ſuch effects on them, that they became ſtill as Lambs. However fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no more Forces were in <hi>Europe</hi> preparing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the main deſign of his Preparations, having private notice that his Brother <hi>John</hi> was practicing againſt him; and fearing whilſt he was warring abroad, he might loſe his Kingdom at home, he reſolved to make ſuch Conditions with the <hi>Turkiſh Sultan,</hi> as might be beſt for the Settlement and Peace of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> But the crafty <hi>Infidel</hi> being very ſenſible of the weak condition the <hi>Chriſtian Army</hi> was in, would not hearken to any other Terms than to have all the Towns that were taken, <hi>Ptolomais</hi> Excepted, ſurrendered; and upon that condition they ſhould be ſuffered to have a quiet Enjoyment of their Effects, and to Trade in the Country; and ſo having made this Agreement, and Sold the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> for a Sum of Money to <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>Luſingham, the laſt Chriſtian King of</hi> Jeruſalem, though at that time but in Name, which Title he confered on King <hi>Richard,</hi> (and it laſted to many of our Kings afterward, who were ſtiled <hi>Kings
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61951:208"/> of</hi> Jeruſalem) he Embarked in divers Veſſels with his Queen, who had accompanied him in that dangerous Voyage, and Sailed for <hi>England;</hi> but the Ship he was in, being ſeparated from the reſt of the Fleet in a Storm, was driven on the Coaſt of <hi>Hiſtria,</hi> lying between <hi>Aquileia</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was Ship-Wrack'd, and ſaving his Life by Swimming, was made Priſoner, and preſented to the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in whoſe Territories he Landed; but the Queen, who was in another Ship, and the reſt of the Fleet, came ſafe to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King by misfortune thus made a Priſoner to his Enemy, whom he had diſguſted by throwing down his Standard, as is ſaid, was Sold by him for 40000 Pounds to the Emperer <hi>Frederick,</hi> who ſet his Ranſom at 100000 Pounds, Fourſcore Thouſand of which was raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> but Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> was conſtrained to Pay the other Twenty Thouſand Pounds, before he could be releaſed from the <hi>Popes Curſe,</hi> pronounced againſt him for making a Prince his Priſoner, who for the honour of the <hi>Chriſtian Name,</hi> had Warred Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> So that after almoſt a Years Impriſonment, the King was ſet at Liberty; of which <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French King</hi> had no ſooner notice, but be ſent <hi>John</hi> the Kings Brother word, <hi>The Devil was got looſe again.</hi> However he did not immediately return to <hi>England,</hi> but went to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and with the Terror of his coming frighted the <hi>French</hi> out of many ſtrong holds they had taken in his abſence; then raiſing a puiſſant Army, he entered <hi>France,</hi> waſting all before him with Fire and Sword, reducing to his Subjection all ſuch places as had been taken, and made the Rebellious <hi>Norman</hi> Peers, who had engaged in the <hi>French Faction,</hi> proſtrate themſelves before him, whoſe humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he accepted, and accordingly Pardoned them, on promiſes of future Obedience and Fidelity.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:61951:208"/>
                  <p>Let me now ſpeak of ſomething that happened Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in <hi>England</hi> during the Kings abſence: I told you he had left the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Regent; This Man being of mean Parentage, his Grandfather a Plowman, and himſelf the Son of a Cowheard, ſoon forgot his Original, (as ſuch moſtly do who are raiſed from a low Eſtate to high Promotion) and grew ſo Inſolently Proud, that he would not Ride abroad without a Guard of 500 Men to attend him, his Table was exceeding Expenſive on the Publick Coſt, and his Inſolencies over all ſorts (as well the <hi>Clergy</hi> as <hi>Laiety</hi>) was ſo great, that he ſoon procured himſelf a Univerſal Hatred, yet a while he Proudly ſpread his <hi>Peacocks Train,</hi> being Served at his Table, and every where Waited on by the Sons of Noblemen, to whom he gave in Marriage (with ſome Portion and Preferment) divers of his <hi>Ruſtick Kindred,</hi> thinking thereby to ſtrengthen his Intereſt; but this proved to him a broken Reed, for finding he was generally hated by the Nobles and Commons, to ſhun the ſtorm that threatened him with ſome violent End, he ſewed up many Jewels and ſome Gold in the Garments of a <hi>Pedlar Woman,</hi> and Diſguiſed in that Habit reſolved to leave the Land, carrying under his Arm a piece of Country Cloath, which he offering to ſale at <hi>Dover,</hi> was Diſcovered, and Seized, ſuffering much outrage from the Common People; and being ſent to <hi>London,</hi> the Lords Committed him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he remained till the Kings return; who not only releaſed him, but reſtored him to his Biſhoprick; yet having ſeen the folly of his Pride, he grew more Humble, and ſhortly after Travelling to <hi>Rome</hi> Dyed by the way, unlamented by all that had known his former carriage.</p>
                  <p>The Queen-Mother, in the Kings abſence, perceiving her Son <hi>John</hi>'s aſpiring, who had a hand in bringing the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61951:209"/> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> into Diſgrace, and Outing him, made a ſtrong Party of her Friends, as ſoon as ſhe heard King <hi>Richard</hi> was a Priſoner, compelling the Nobles, and ſuch others as were in Offices and Truſts, to Swear to be True to him, and Conſerve the Realm to his uſe and behoof; and <hi>John</hi> hearing he was Releaſed, and in <hi>Normandy,</hi> haſted to excuſe himſelf, ſubmitting to his Grace and Mercy, voluntarily ſurrendering all the Forts and Caſtles he had Seized into his hands, ſaying, <hi>What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e had done he was provoked to do by the Extraordinary Pride and Inſolent Behaviour of the Biſhop of</hi> Ely, <hi>who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily had diſordered the Government of the Realm, and particularly for the Outrages he had committed on the Perſon of</hi> Jeffery <hi>Arch Biſhop of</hi> York, <hi>the Kings Brother:</hi> Yet by the Peers he was Condemned in the Forfeiture of his Goods, Eſtate and Honours, but not long after received them again, and was reſtored to the Kings Favour, and came with him to <hi>England,</hi> where the King at his Landing was Joyfully received by <hi>Hubert,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and moſt of the Nobles; cauſing himſelf a ſecond time to be Crowned, and the Coronation Solemnity was performed at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> Then he made a new <hi>Broad-Seal,</hi> by which device he got much Money out of his Subjects, who were obliged to have their Patents, Royal Grants for Offices, and other Evidences, new Sealed; the former being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared null and void. And yet this not ſufficing to put the Kingdom in a good Settlement, pay his Soldiers Arrears, and repay the Money that had been taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt for his Ranſom, the Treaſuries of <hi>Religious Houſes</hi> were ranſacked; and a Parliament being called, he was allowed to reaſſume into his hands ſuch Mannors, Lordſhips, Lands and Offices as had been diſpoſed of at his ſetting out to the <hi>Holy War,</hi> for Ready Money; ſo that the Purchaſers were enforced to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>After this, as the King was at Dinner, in his Palace of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> News came to him that the <hi>French</hi> had Beſieged <hi>Nerville</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> upon which, in a great Paſſion he Swore <hi>He would never turn his back till he had got thither with his Army;</hi> and to ſave his Oath, a place by order was immediatly broken in the Wall through which he paſſed, the breach heing left open above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years afterward, in Remembrance of it; and his Arrival ſo terrified the <hi>French,</hi> That they no ſooner heard of his Landing, but they raiſed the Siege: Yet purſuing this Advantage, he gave a mighty Army of them Battel near <hi>Gyſors,</hi> ſlaying great numbers, and putting the reſt to Flight, he not having half their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Whereupon ſaid he, <hi>Not we, but Dieu Et Mondroit,</hi> that is, <hi>God and our Right, hath obtained this Victory.</hi> After which, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> made it their Motto under their Arms; and ſo he proſecuting this Victory, took many Towns.

                  </p>
                  <p>Scarcely was King <hi>John</hi> Settled in his Throne, but <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> underhand aſſiſted by others, ſent for <hi>Arthur</hi> to his Court, proteſting a great deal of Love and tender Affection to him; Informed him of his Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> Dutchy of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and <hi>Britany,</hi> animating him to raiſe his Spirits, and uſe his Courage, for the recovery of what was ſo unjuſtly taken from him; and that if he were deſtitute of Friends that might Adviſe and Council him, he and his Nobles would willingly ſupply that defect; if he wanted Gold or Silver, the Sinews of War, his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſhould be open at his Service; or if Valiant Men to Fight for him and his Right, many Thouſand <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> would venture their Lives in his Quarrel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe large and Friendly proffers, which rather proceeded from the fear King <hi>Philip</hi> had of <hi>Englands</hi> Strength and Proſperity, which might (as indeed it
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61951:214"/> afterwards fell out) get the Aſcendant over <hi>France</hi>) than for any cordial Love he bore to the Young Prince, keeping him only as a Trump Card in his hand, to play his Game as he ſaw occaſion: However theſe great Proffers bore up his Spirits, and he wholly caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the <hi>French King</hi> for Protection; ſubmitting to be Governed and Ruled by him in all things: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Forces were Levied in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and hereupon ſome Strong Holds in the latter, Revolted from King <hi>John,</hi> and declared for Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and others they won; however the Kings Lieutenant raiſed Forces to oppoſe them; ſo that between both Armies there happened divers Encounters, with various ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>John</hi> hearing of theſe ſtirs in <hi>Normandy,</hi> thought there remained no time for delay, but gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrong Power paſſed the Seas, and joyning with his Lieutenant retook ſeveral Towns, and Overthrew the Young Prince in a ſet Battel, with great Slaughter of the <hi>French</hi> Nobles and others, that were Engaged with him.</p>
                  <p>This made the <hi>French King</hi> begin to conſider he had laid hold on the wrong end of the ſtaff, and from that time procured divers Prelates, and ſome Princes, as Mediators, to bring on Foot a Treaty for a Peace; which Treaty gave both ſides a ſhort breathing: But the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Propoſals being no leſs than the reſtoring all the Towns taken, a defraying of the charges of the War, and that King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould put for ever Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> out of his Protection, it came in the end to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo that the War renewed more furious than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by which means the poor Inhabitants of <hi>Normandy</hi> were grievouſly Oppreſſed, by Burning, Plundering, and many other Miſeries attendant on Hoſtilities.</p>

And that the King ſhould not be at leaſure to Regain it, the <hi>French King</hi> underhand found him work at home, by making <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the Third his Enemy. For about this time,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing of theſe unwarantable Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, was much diſpleaſed; which ſo affrighted the Monks, that to regain his Favour they proceeded to a ſecond Election, and choſe <hi>John Grey,</hi> a Perſon whom the King had nominated to them, who was then Biſhop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> and ſo the Kings Anger being appeaſed, he ſent Ambaſſadors with his Letters to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to Ratify the ſecond Choice. But in the mean time a new Schiſm or Faction appeared; for the Suffragan (becauſe he was not made acquainted, nor an Actor in either of the ſaid two Elections) made ſuit to the <hi>Pope</hi> to diſplace them both.) But he, imitating the proud Example of many of his Predeceſſors, who covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſwim againſt the ſtream, and ſeldom or never granted any Kings requeſt, leaſt in ſome ſort they ſhould be thought to be yeilding, neglected both their ſuits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confirmed <hi>Raynold</hi> who was firſt choſen: But the King growing angry hereat, the Monks to pleaſe him, rather out of fear than complacency, refuſed to receive into their Quire, or own the Arch Biſhop the <hi>Pope</hi> had Confirmed, tho' he was of their own chuſing; giving this Reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was done Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinly, and at an unſeaſonable Time, for as much as the choice was made in the Night, when as it ſhould have been done in the open Day; and ſo they concluded it void, and in it ſelf a Nulity, yet remained good, till by Judicial Proceedings, and a Sentence, it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced void; ſo that this matter was Controverted at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> made ſpecious ſhews and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61951:216"/> of accomodating the matter to heal the Schiſme, ſo that it ſhould be to the ſatisfaction of the King and Monks; but his aim was otherwiſe, for he deſigned to prefer a creature of his own, <hi>viz. Stephen Langton,</hi> a Man that would always move by his dictates, having before been made <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Chriſogone,</hi> and privatly he Wrote to the Monks to Chooſe him; yet not ſo cunningly but the King had Notice of it, and ſtrictly charged them not to proceed to any other Election; but the <hi>Popes</hi> Threats and Promiſes of Rewards, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with their Obedience to the Kings Commands ſo that they did Elect him their Arch Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>This ſo exaſperated the King, that he commanded, on ſevere Penalties, no Appeals ſhould be made to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that from thence forth he would take a ſtrict account of ſuch of his Subjects that for any matter of Right or Juſtice ſhould go to <hi>Rome</hi> to require it, ſeeing he had Prelates, Noblemen, and Judges ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any Controverſies within his Kingdom, that ſhould ariſe, either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-Weal;</hi> and added, That he would rather expoſe himſelf to Ten Thouſand Deaths, than baſely (as he was required) make himſelf and his Kingdom Servil to the <hi>Popes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency and Peremptory Commands. But on the other ſide, the <hi>Pope</hi> threatened what he would do if he was not Obey'd in the Election of <hi>Langton,</hi> and the calling home ſuch Monks as had Fled through fear of the Kings diſpleaſure, on this laſt Election; and becauſe this was not ſpeedily done, he ſent his Apoſtolical Command to the Prelates of <hi>London, Ely, Worceſter, &amp;c.</hi> to Interdict the Kingdom, if the King continued in his obſtinacy (as he termed it.) This Commiſſion was put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Church-Doors were ſhut up for ſeveral Years: Some Authors ſay Six; there being neither Prayers, Sermons, Chriſtenings, nor Service at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals

                  <p>For this Affront the King Baniſhed divers Biſhops and others of the Clergy, whom he found moſt forward in complying with the <hi>Popes</hi> Intereſt, ſeizing on their Temporalities, reſolving to take the like courſe with all ſuch as conſented to receive Promotions, Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Eccleſiaſtical Degrees from the Pope or new Arch Biſhop; or that went to <hi>Rome</hi> upon any occaſion without his Licenſe, or did attempt to put in Execution any Command from the <hi>Pope</hi> within his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> no ſooner heard of this, but reſolving not to cool on it, he ſent into <hi>England</hi> two Legates, <hi>viz. Pandulph</hi> and <hi>Durant,</hi> to perſwade the King to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to <hi>Langton,</hi> and the other Biſhops and Clergy that were under his Diſpleaſure in <hi>England,</hi> or in Baniſhment, to reſtore them to their Lands, Places, and Goods; that a good underſtanding might be renewed between the <hi>Pope</hi> and him.</p>
                  <p>This did but little pleaſe the King; yet however, fearing to be Accurſed, and Embroyl himſelf in new Troubles (for in thoſe days the <hi>Popes</hi> Leaden Sword did more miſchief in Kingdoms than many of Steel, People being for the moſt part infatuated to believe what he did he did by the immediate Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, whoſe Vicegerent he aſſumed to himſelf to be) He promiſed to perform all, but allowing the Election of Cardinal <hi>Langton,</hi> proteſting that if another might be choſen he would yet prefer him to ſome other Biſhoprick; but the Imperious Legates, inſtead of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Kings Requeſt, pronounced the <hi>Popes Curſe</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61951:217"/> not only againſt the King, but all Perſons who ſhould do him Service, or give him Attendance, or ſupply him with things Neceſſary, Abſolving his Subjects from their Allegiance, Duties, and Oaths, requiring all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes to make War upon him, as upon the Arch and Grand Enemy of the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The Pope alſo publiſhed and pronounced againſt him Sentence of Deprivation, and gave his Crown and his Kingdom to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, if by any ſecret Plot or open Violence and Hoſtility he could Expel or Murther him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Fruits of this (pretended Holy) un-Holy Father, The Popes Religion and Government; and this Uſurping Arrogance was a badg of his unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Pride, in that he preſumed to do what no Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creature can do, nor what a Chriſtian ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do againſt a Prince, who is Gods Anointed, and againſt ſuch a one as the Almighty has placed in his Kingdom to Govern and Rule his People.</p>
                  <p>Yet this Fulmination did not much ſtartle King <hi>John;</hi> and being determined to know the minds of his People, how they ſtood affected to him after this matter, he took a ſollemn Oath of them for the defence of his Perſon, and the performance of faithful Service to him; and then raiſing an Army, he went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe that King (encouraged by the Pope) was practicing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſheltering ſuch as had taken part with the Pope and fled out of <hi>England:</hi> But King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Second perceiving that Fire and Sword began to devour apace in his Country, he with much Humility ſent to King <hi>John</hi> to deſire him to ſpare his People and their Subſtance, and what in reaſon he required he would accord to, and a Peace was made ſhortly between them, he conſenting to Baniſh all the Kings Enemies out of his Country.</p>

                  <p>This much diſappointed <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was preparing to Invade <hi>England,</hi> and had to that end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a gallant Army; but by the Wiſdom, Valour and Circumſpection of King <hi>John,</hi> and the Providence of God, 300 of his Ships Laden with Corn and other Proviſions and Neceſſaries for the Invaſion, were Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by our Ships, which great diſapointment, put an end at that time to the Deſign, and fruſtrated his vain hope. But after all this, the King finding ſo many Efforts and Treacheries againſt him, that diſparing to weather every one of them, and pittying the ſufferings of his People under theſe diſtractions, he ſuddainly, without the Advice of his Nobles, or of his Privy Council, degenerating from his former daring and boldneſs of Spirit, fell on his Knees before the Legate, acknowledging his Diſobedience, craving of him the Popes Pardon, reſigning (with his Crown) the poſſeſſion of his Kingdom to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> which Crown the proud Prelate took, and to put him into ſome pain in conſidering whether he ſhould ever have it reſtored again, kept it Four Days, and then returned it to the uſe of him and his Heirs, reſerving 1000 Marks Yearly, by way of Tribute to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was the main thing the Pope had aimed at, and for which he had all the while made ſuch a prodigious noiſe and buſtle.</p>
                  <p>But this low and Un-Prince-like Submiſſion to a paltry Prieſt, threw him into another miſchief, which was the contempt and diſlike of his Nobles; ſo that for the moſt part they Revolted from him, and entered upon a cruel and unnatural War, which went very near to have enſlaved this flouriſhing Iſland once more to Strangers; for the Barons finding they were too weak to oppoſe the King, they leaned on <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Frrnce,</hi> propoſing, if he would aſſiſt them with ſufficient
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61951:218"/> Forces and Money, they would ſoon Depoſe King <hi>John,</hi> and place the Crown upon the Head of <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son to <hi>Philip:</hi> This News fired the Young Ambitious <hi>French Prince,</hi> who had alſo ſomething of a Martial Spirit, that he never left urging his Father, till he had furniſhed him out with an Army. But the <hi>Pope</hi> having now cloſed with King <hi>John,</hi> on his complaining of this to him, he ſent his ſtrict command under many Threats, to the <hi>French King</hi> not to ſuffer his Son to paſs the Seas, or in the leaſt to moleſt a Kingdom under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Holy See;</hi> tho' as you have heard, a little before himſelf had given it to them. But <hi>Popes</hi> uſually blow hot or cold, as their Intereſt Ebbs or Flows; and therefore it was no wonder he ſhould ſo ſoon change his ſide. But <hi>Philip</hi> refuſed to Obey his Mandate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Anſwer, <hi>That no King without the conſent of his Nobles, Prelates, and Common People, can Subject his Kingdom to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>or put it under its Protection; it being Committed to them by God, and conſequently this Kingdom was not holden of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor ought to be Defended or Protected by her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Anſwer ſomewhat ſtartled the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet uſing his old way, he ſent <hi>Guallo</hi> his Legate, Cardinal of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> to Curſe <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, and ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility as took part with them, as alſo all their other Adherents and Accomplices; and tho' the wiſer ſort little minded this, yet the ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Soldiers, whoſe Devotion more directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on Fear, than Knowledge, or Judgment, to apprehend any danger that could enſue from ſuch threats, were ſo amazed and daunted, that they left their Leaders in the Field, and returned home to their Wives and Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Raſcally ſort in <hi>England,</hi> hearing divers Noblemen were under this Curſe, entered into their Houſes, Fields and Parks,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61951:219"/> Robbing, Spoiling, and bearing away whatever they could find of value, being ſo far from doubting or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with their own Conſciences whether they did well in it or not, that (ſuch was the blindneſs of thoſe Times) they ſuppoſed their ſo doing tended to the Glory of God Almighty, and that their Rapin and Violence was well pleaſing in his Sight; yet this haſtened many of the Lords, who had little left to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on, to ſubmit to the King, and proſtrate at his Feet confeſs their undutiful Revolt, and crave his Pardon. Upon this they were received into Favour, with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reproofs for their former failures, and were reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Eſtates and Honours; ſo that the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that had happened were by this means ſettled, and a Peace for a time enſued, to the great refreſhing of a Nation wearied out with Inteſtine Broyls.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> intending to make his Proceedings with King <hi>John</hi> a Preſident to other Princes, Aſſembled a General Council at <hi>Lateran,</hi> where he cauſed to be publiſhed, at large, the Aſſignment of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there <hi>Otho</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon, Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> were Excomunicated, for no other material reaſon, than not ſubmitting themſelves and Principalities to the <hi>Popes</hi> Pride and Inſolency, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure: Alſo the Empire, Kingdom, and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity appertaining to them, were Interdicted, on preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hereſie. In this Council <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were Decreed, the Cup taken from the Laity in the <hi>Communion, &amp;c.</hi> And it was made no leſs than Eternal Damnation to ſuch as ſhould ſpeak evil of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and that they who were guilty of it, ſhould immediatly when they Dyed deſcend into Hell, without being admitted by the way to call in at Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to take leave of any of their Acquaintance: And
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61951:219"/> that no Man ſhould preſume to take on him the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Diadem, till he was Sworn the <hi>Popes</hi> Vaſſal, paid him Homage, and received that Crown at his Hands. But theſe Princes deſpiſed him and his idle Menaces; yet he ſecretly wrought them many Troubles, and put their Subjects into Rebellion; but in time the Storm blew over, with the end of his reſtleſs Life.</p>
                  <p>During theſe ſtirs, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fell into Rebellion, but were ſoon Quieted on the Kings going over; for at <hi>Dublin</hi> he was met by Twenty of their petty Kings, who ſubmitted, and promiſed him their future Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And one <hi>Gualter Maxes</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Preached againſt the Pride of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and wrote a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Revelation of the Romiſh Goliah;</hi> for which the Biſhops greatly Perſecuted him. And the Clergy not being heartily reconciled to the King, becauſe he had controuled them in many things, as he was in his Progreſs to ſettle the Kingdom, ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and out of order, Dining at <hi>Swinſtead-Abby,</hi> not far from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> one <hi>Simon,</hi> a Villanous Monk, who ſerved at the Table, being of the Order of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Poiſoned him, by delivering into his hand a Bowl of Intoxicated Wine, and Poiſoned himſelf alſo for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the King compelling him, (upon ſuſpecting (by a ſuddain pain in his Stomach) ſome Treachery) to Drink part of it: Too eaſy a Death for ſuch a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in wickedneſs; who conſidered not that Kings are God's Anointed, and that the Affront is put upon Heaven when they are Injured.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell King <hi>John,</hi> after a troubleſom Reign for the moſt part, when he had Reigned 17 Years, 6 Months, and 13 Days. He Dyed on the 19th of <hi>October Anno Dom.</hi> 1216. and was Buried at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To palliate this execrable Murther, it was given out that he ſhould ſay, holding a Halfpeny Loaf in his hand,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61951:220"/> 
                     <hi>That if he lived a Twelve-month, he would make it at the Rate of Twelve Pence;</hi> and that he ſhould have Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed the Maſs, when the <hi>Pope</hi> had Accurſed him, upon cuming to the Quarry of a Buck that was Slain in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>viz. See how fair and fat this Buck is, that never heard Maſs in all its Life:</hi> That when he was vexed with the Rebellious Barons, he ſhould ſend to <hi>Mira Mula,</hi> a prevaling King in <hi>Africa,</hi> for Aſſiſtance; promiſing him to turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and hold his Kingdom Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary of him, if by his help he prevailed over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But theſe ſeem to be Monkiſh Stories, raiſed to poiſon his Fame as well as Body, and are Rejected by Authentic Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>In the Ninth Year of his Reign, by a New Charter, he enabled the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> for their good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done him, to make their Annual Choice of a Mayor and two Sherifs, for the better Government of the City.</p>
                  <p>In his Reign <hi>London-Bridge</hi> was Built with Stone-Arches, as ſtill it remains, being before only of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and a dreadful Fire happening on it, taking both Ends, by the vehemency of the Wind carrying the Flame in ſheets from the one to the other, the People that came to Quench it were caught in the middle of the danger, and Boats coming to receive them by Water, they thronged in a hurry ſo faſt into them, that divers Sunk; ſo that in the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Flames</hi> 300 are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to periſh.</p>

                  <head>The Reign of King <hi>HENRY</hi> the Third.</head>
                  <p>AFter the untimely Death of King <hi>John, Henry</hi> his Eldeſt Son being but Nine Years of Age, was <hi>Crowned</hi> at <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Wallo</hi> the Popes Legate, and divers Nobles; and by reaſon of his Non-age, was put under the Gaurdianſhip of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who was by the conſent of the Peers made Protector of the Realm during his Minority; who prudently mannag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affairs, adminiſtring the Laws and Juſtice upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the People: Yet long he had not been Crowned, before <hi>Philip</hi> the French King, thinking to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this change, dealt underhand with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Noblemen, and ſuppoſing by this means he had made a ſtrong Party in <hi>England,</hi> Invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet the Protector was not idle in his Charge, but Leavied a conſiderable Army; and though the <hi>Welſh,</hi> under <hi>Llewellin</hi> their Prince, Rebelled, to favour the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61951:225"/> proceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> he made head againſt them, and ſtopt their Ravages, before a ſufficient Force could come to his Camp from other parts, and ſlew many of them in ſeveral Skirmiſhes, tho' as yet they came to no conſiderable Battel.</p>
                  <p>And now Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> being Dead, and <hi>Honorius</hi> ſeated in the Pontifical Chair taking part with King <hi>Henry,</hi> not only confirmed the power of his Predeceſſors Apoſtolical Legate in <hi>England,</hi> but by him Curſed Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> who came over with the <hi>French</hi> Forces to take poſſeſſion of this Realm, and all his Adherents, Excommunicating and Depriving them of all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Chriſtians; which put a ſtop to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer: So that <hi>Lewis</hi> made ſhew as if he only waited for a fit opportunity to depart, yet in the mean time King <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, with great care and coſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Reinforcements, and Shiped them for <hi>England:</hi> But <hi>Hugh d' Burg,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> Manned out a Fleet, upon notice they were putting to Sea; and after a ſharp Engagement, Sunk, Burnt, and Took the greateſt part of the Enemys Ships, which conſiſted of 150 Sail. This Exploit got him a good eſteem among the People, which he after loſt by his Covetouſneſs, as will appear, and much daunted the <hi>French</hi> that were already in <hi>England,</hi> making Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> intreat the Popes Legate to Abſolve him; and for ſo much Money as would defray the charges of his Return, he promiſed to deliver up all the Caſtles and Places he had in his poſſeſſion; which being done and agreed to, he Sailed for <hi>France,</hi> and left his Friends in <hi>England</hi> to ſhift for themſelves; many of which were forced into Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome of the more forward taken and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but the greater Number Pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, a Parliament was called, and in it the Antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61951:225"/> other good Laws, made by ſucceeding Kings, were reduced into a ſmaller compaſs, what ſeemed ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to the Conſtitution of the then preſent Government, being left out. And this has continued a happineſs to the Kingdom, being that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>Great Charter</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that ſet a Barrier between the Succeeding Kings and the People; That the one ſhould not encroach on the Subjects Rights, but live as free born Subjects; nor the other upon the Prerogative of the Crown, but that the Scale ſhould be in a due Ballance between Soveraign and Subject. This was Ratified and Confirmed under the Great Seal, to the high ſatisfaction of the Kingdom; ſo that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Granting the King a conſiderable Tax, the People paid it with all the alacrity immaginable, with which Money he not only diſcharged his Debts, but Levied a formidable Army, who under the Leading of <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings Brother, and divers Nobles, won much back again that the <hi>French</hi> had taken during the Troubles in his Fathers Reign, entirely reducing the Provinces of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoyne;</hi> and returning with little loſs of Men from this Glorious Enterprize, were received with great Joy: However the abſence of the Army gave the <hi>French</hi> King leaſure to practice his uſual method of ſtiring up Differences and Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in thoſe places, by which means he ſurprized ſome Towns; but King <hi>Henry</hi> grown up, and being a Prince of Courage and Valour, reſolved to go in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; whoſe Arrival ſo terrified the <hi>French,</hi> that they Deſerted divers Places without contending; and thoſe that yielded not on Summons, were taken by Force.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King perceiving the Cowardize of his own Men, and the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> after many loſſes began to ſtudy how he might come to a Peace; and upon ſurrendering what he had poſſeſſed himſelf
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61951:226"/> of, it was concluded, advantagiouſly enough to the Honour of King <hi>Henry</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. But ſoon after this, ſome diſcontented Nobles at home, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to Alienate the minds of his Subjects from him, upon a Jealouſie that he repoſed his greateſt confidence in Strangers, and made little account of their Fidelity; but to prevent any Eruption that might give his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad the advantage of Regaining what they had Loſt, and what coſt him much Treaſure in Recovering, he Laboured to reconcile himſelf to them, and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many Strangers from his Court; with whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was much peſtered, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles had ſome reaſon to complain of it; by which means, and ſome other Conceſſions, a Reconcilement was made. And now the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> Dying without Iſſue Male, leaving only Four Daughters, the King Seized his Poſſeſſions, and Annexed them to the Crown, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting them with large additions of Yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, Regal Priviledges and Honours, giving the Ladies in lieu of it divers Caſtles, Lordſhips, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, which exceeded their own in true value; and having Married Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, to <hi>Elianor</hi> Siſter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he gave him the Province of <hi>Guyan,</hi> and the Lordſhip of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and created him Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which two latter Dignities he then annexed as inſeparable Titles to the Eldeſt Sons of the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo they at this day continue; ſoon after this, the King nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped being Murthered by an <hi>Oxford</hi> Scholar, who about Midnight crept in at the Window of that Chamber where he uſually Repoſed, but that Night he was abſent at a Merri-making; however the Student being found there with unuſual Weapons about him, upon Examination Confeſſed he came with the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Deſign, but would not acknowledg what

                  <p>This continued happy to him for a time; but his Court not being purged of Paraſites, and Whiſperers, who with their ſtories ſet him againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a fatal Diſcord befel, which at times laſted till his Death; for the Nobles grudging he beſtowed Favours on thoſe that deſerved them not, and was ſcanty in his Liberalities towards them that had Merited of him, at the expence of their Blood and Treaſure, from Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring they fell to open Reproaches, charging him with the violation of thoſe Liberties and Priviledges that he had ſo ſolemnly Confirmed and Granted: This Angered the King, and made him inwardly Fret, but finding they ſpoke the ſenſe of the greateſt part of the Nation, to bring things to a quieter temper, and alay or ſatisfie the diſcontents of his Subjects, he called a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> tho' in it what he aimed at was, for the moſt part, if not altogether, fruſtrated; ſo that it was afterward, through the Diſtractions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon it, called <hi>Inſanum Parliamentum,</hi> or <hi>The Mad Parliament:</hi> For when multitudes of ſuch as were Grieved came for Redreſs of their Grievances, the Lords and Commons endeavouring to Redreſs what was amiſs, Eſtabliſhed many things Profitable, as they intended, for the Common-Weal, but highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Kings Prerogative; and to the end thoſe things that they had ſo contrived, ſhould be laſting, and inviolably obſerved, they made choice of Twelve Noblemen, by the Title of <hi>Les douze Piers,</hi> or <hi>The
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61951:228"/> Twelve Peers,</hi> giving them abſolute Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Maintain and Support thoſe Laws; of whom the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> were chief; and for this they had their Pattent, and took a ſolemn Oath, which was Sealed and Ratified by the King, although he did it unwillingly; ſo that the Parliament being ended, the Commiſſioners began by ſtrict Execution to give Life unto thoſe Laws and Ordinances, thruſting out of their Places and Offices many of the Kings Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Servants, and Attendants, placing others in their ſtead, which very much troubled him; for by theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings he perceived thoſe that waited on his Perſon, were rather to be Truſted by others than by himſelf; and that he ſhould be furtheſt from chuſing thoſe that were to be neareſt to him; this made him grow Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and vex himſelf exceedingly; yet thinking to mend what he ſuppoſed amiſs, he called another Parliament, which contrary to his expectation Ratified and Confirmed more ſtrongly all that the former had done, tho' he at the opening of the Seſſions had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the hard Uſage he had received from the Twelve Peers; and by the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Nine other Biſhops of the Kingdom, a ſolemn Curſe was denounced againſt all ſuch as either by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Council, Arms, or otherwiſe, withſtood or hindered the Execution of thoſe Laws, or the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Twelve Peers. This made the King more Melancholy than before; when, to divert himſelf he Sailed to <hi>France,</hi> and had an Enterview with King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who highly welcomed him, Lodged him in his own Palace, Feaſted him, and uſed him with all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, Curteſie, and Honour; proteſting in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Eſtates, That he was much diſſatisfied in his Conſcience for detaining from King <hi>Henry</hi> his Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> and ſuch other Territories in <hi>France</hi> as
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61951:229"/> in Right he ought to Enjoy; and on the other hand King <hi>Henry</hi> intending to conclude an inviolable Peace freely ſurrendered to him <hi>Normandy, Anjou, Poictiers</hi> and <hi>Mayn,</hi> and in the ſame Parliament with great Solemnity and Honour, he received them again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Heirs.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt things thus proceeded in <hi>France,</hi> a Quarrel happened between Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings Son, and the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> about the Laws being put too ſeverely in Execution; which made the King haſten home, to prevent the Danger or Miſchief that might happen thereby, and with ſome difficulty he reconciled them; and hoping to remove the curb the Peers had laid on him, with much Expence, he procured Bulls of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, by virtue of which himſelf and all others who had Sworn to maintain thoſe new Laws and Ordinances, and to ſupport the proceedings of the Peers and their Authority, were freely Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Oaths; yet they took no notice of it, but proceeded to diſplace ſuch Judges, Juſtices, and Sheriffs, as the King had appointed, for not following their Orders, and put ſuch in their Places and Offices as they thought fit: So that the King being no longer able to endure theſe Indignities, cauſed the Popes Bulls to be Read and Proclaimed in the chief Towns and Cities of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> ſtraightly Commanding all Perſons, of what Eſtate, Condition or Degree ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, That from thence forth did by Word or Deed Support or Maintain the ſaid Laws and Ordinances, or the Authority of the Twelve Peers, that they ſhould be committed to Priſon, and not delivered thence without the Kings conſent: And hereupon he Swore the <hi>Londoners</hi> from twelve Years Old, and upwards, to be True and Faithful to him, and to be Aiding to him and his Heirs againſt all Oppoſers. In the mean while
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61951:229"/> the Barons met, and entered into a Reſolution among themſelves, rather to loſe their Lives than decline the upholding the Laws; and fancying the King had ſome deſperate deſign upon them, their Jealouſie ſo encreaſed, that retiring to the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> they raiſed a ſtrong Army, and furniſhed it with all things neceſſary for the War they intended; yet pretended to abſtain from any Hoſtility or Violence, unleſs the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to it. Then they ſent their Letters in a moſt ſubmiſſive and humble manner to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting their Duty, Service, and true Allegiance to him; entreating his Highneſs for the Honour of Almighty God, for the health of his own Soul, and for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs of his People and Kingdom, utterly to defie (except his Queen and Children) all ſuch as Councelled him, or did themſelves intend to ſuppreſs the Laws and Ordinances eſtabliſhed in the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the Authority and Power, which for the advantage of the common good, was Granted to the Twelve Peers. But the King diſpleaſed at theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, returned not any Anſwer; which made them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their Banners, and march towards <hi>London;</hi> and as they paſſed by the Houſes of ſuch as favoured the Kings proceedings, on the account of the Popes Bulls, they Plundered and Spoiled them, and laid many in Ruins by Fire, Proclaiming ſuch Perſons Enemies to the King and Government.</p>
                  <p>Approaching <hi>London,</hi> they ſent their Letters to the Mayor and Citizens, to know whether they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſupport the Laws and Ordinances or not, and the Authority of the Twelve Peers; proteſting before God, that themſelves meant not, nor intended any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; and if they were found defective in any point, a ſpeedy Reformation ſhould be made.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters were no ſooner received and read,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61951:230"/> but they were ſent to the King, who demanded of the Mayor and Citizens whether they would ſupport thoſe Laws and the Twelve Peers, or renounce them; but fearing their Plunder when ſuch an Army was at their Gates, they Aſſembled in Common-Hall, and agreed to ſend the King Anſwer, That they would ſtand by the Laws and Peers, tho' a little before they had Sworn to the King to ſtand by him againſt all oppoſers. This greatly diſpleaſed the King; but they ſetting light by his Anger, received the Barons with their Army into the City, with many expreſſions of Joy; and from hence they Marched to <hi>Windſor Caſtle,</hi> and diſplaced all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, rifling them of what they had gotten by their Places and Offices, eſpecially ſuch as the Prince had put into Truſt; this yet more offended the King: But his Privy Council laboured to pacify him, by ſending to the Barons to reſtore the Goods taken from the Aliens, and telling him that from thenceforth none but himſelf ſhould place Perſons in Truſt; but to neither of theſe the Barons would accord; but at laſt concluded to put the deſciſion of the Controverſie to <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King, and inviolably ſtand to his Award; and King <hi>Henry</hi> agreeing to it, Peace for a time enſued; and the Swords on both ſides were Sheathed; and the matter Stated on either part being controverted before the French King, it was by him Decreed, <hi>That all the ſaid Ordinances and Laws ſhould be Annihilated, and from thenceforth no Authority or Power ſhould be left in the Twelve Peers.</hi> But this Sentence was ſo diſtaſteful to the Barons, that they publickly accuſed him of Partiality to curry-favour with King <hi>Henry,</hi> abſolutely refuſing to ſtand by his Award; and ſo ſtrongly were they bent to maintain whatſoever had been in Parliament Eſtabliſhed, That they repaired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Levied new Forces;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61951:230"/> and in their paſſage to <hi>London,</hi> Spoiled and Burnt the Goods, Lordſhips and Houſes of Sr. <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> who had Counſeled the King againſt them: To oppoſe their Proceedings, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> Marched with the Kings Army againſt them; and a cruel Battel was fought for the ſpace of a whole Day, in which the Prince Acted Wonders beyond what could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Young Years: But moſt of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being Slain, he was at length compelled to leave the Field, and March haſtily back again with his broken Army, leaving the Barons Maſters of the Field.</p>
                  <p>After this Victory, the Barons Marched their Army to <hi>London,</hi> where they were received with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Joy; and ſoon after the Rifraff of the City, contrary to the minds of the ſober Citizens, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to themſelves two Captains, whom they ſtiled <hi>Conſtables</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and made Proclamation, <hi>That all who were affected to their Party ſhould take Arms, upon Ringing the great Bell at St.</hi> Pauls; and ſo Aſſembling in a Tumultuous manner, they committed many Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the Houſes of thoſe that did not approve their Proceedings; and then in a great troop went to the Palace of <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Brother, who by the <hi>German</hi> Princes had been Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and entering it by force, ſeized and carried away all his Plate, Treaſure and Rich Furniture, pulling down and defacing, for the moſt part, that ſtately Building.</p>
                  <p>This made him, of a Friend, ever after an Enemy to the City and Barons: For whereas before he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a Reconcilement between the King and them, he utterly gave over that good office, and exaſperated him to continue the War againſt them; ſo that the King having notice that Sr. <hi>Peter Montfort</hi> had gathered conſiderable Forces near <hi>Northampton,</hi> declaring for the Barons, he Marched thither, whereupon <hi>Mountfort</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:61951:231"/> retired into the Town with his Forces, and was ſtraightly Beſieged; ſo that in a little time it being taken by Aſſault, he with <hi>Simon</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Son, and many others, were taken Priſoners, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in ſeveral Goals, till a further courſe could be taken with them. But the Barons being ſtrong in the Field, little regarded this blow, but advancing their Banners near <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> gave the Kings Army Battel, which continued with ſuch obſtinate cruelty on both ſides, that Fathers and Sons, Brothers and other near Relations Killed one another without Remorſe; and ſuch a havock was made, that the Army on either ſide being much waſted, the King taken Priſoner with his Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after Fourteen Hours deſperate Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſlaughter of 20000 Men on both ſides, the Royal Party by theſe Accidents was ſo weakened, that a Treaty enſued; and it was Agreed, <hi>That the King ſhould by new Articles, and the renewing his Oath, Confirm the Authority granted to the Twelve Peers, and all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Laws;</hi> with this Caution notwithſtanding, <hi>That Two Lords Spiritual, and Two Temporal, ſhould take a View of, and Examine the ſaid Laws and Ordinances, and if they ſaw any reaſon to Amend or Alter them, they might do it, and if they agreed not in their Opinions, Then the Duke of</hi> Britany <hi>as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire, ſhould be inveſted with full Power to Arbitrate and End the Difference:</hi> And the King and his Brother for ſtanding to this, had their Liberty, and gave their two Eldeſt Sons as Hoſtages, who upon that account were detained in the Caſtle of <hi>Dover</hi> about nine Months.</p>
                  <p>Upon this the King called a Parliament, which again croſſed his expectation, by <hi>Confirming and Ratifying the Laws of the</hi> Oxford <hi>Parliament, and Authority of the Twelve Peers,</hi> which conſtrained the King to take a new Oath to maintain them, and the Peers Authority;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61951:231"/> till according to Agreement, if any thing was found amiſs, it ſhould be Reformed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all ſuch as in thoſe Wars, or otherwiſe, had Maintained them, were Pardoned by the King: Whereupon the Young Princes were ſet at Liberty. But ſoon after, fell a Difference between the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the two heads of the Barons Faction, which made them divide into parties to decide their Quarrel by the Sword; yet the King, fearing this might Involve many of his Subjects in Ruin, and ſhake the Quiet of the whole Kingdom, interpoſed his Authority and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to make them Friends: But whilſt this was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the Kings Son, taking advantage of their difference, departed ſecretly from Court, and conſorting with the Earls of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Warren,</hi> Sr. <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> and others, they raiſed an Army on the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and fell on the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Forces with ſuch fury, near <hi>Everſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> that they totally Routed them; and in this Battel the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Simon</hi> his Eldeſt Son, Sr. <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> and many others of note, were Slain; and ſo enraged were the Soldiers, that they diſpitefully uſed the Earls dead Body, by cuting off the Head, Hands, Feet, and Privy Members, ſending them into divers Shires, as Trophies of their Victory.</p>
                  <p>This turn of fortunate Succeſs, ſo ellevated the drooping King, that he reſolved utterly to throw off his Fetters, and aſſume his Kingly Authority uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled; whereupon, whilſt his Enemies were full of fear and miſtruſt, and their ſtrength in a manner utterly broken, he ſummoned a Parliament, which conforming to his will, more through dread of his Anger, than voluntarily, <hi>Repealed the Laws and Ordinances made in the</hi> Oxford <hi>Parliament, diſannuling the Authority of the Twelve Peers; and all Patents, Commiſſions, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61951:232"/> whatſoever, that tended to the Eſtabliſhing and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thoſe things, were by the Kings expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought forth, publickly Cancelled and made void;</hi> by which means he regained his former Power and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to ſay and do as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament was no ſooner ended, but the King expreſſed his anger towards the City of <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as is alledged) the Rulers and Inhabitants had always deſpiſed him, and taken part with the Barons againſt him; vowing to conſume it with Fire, and leave it in a heap of Rubbiſh, as a laſting Monument of their Rebellion to ſucceeding Ages; and ſo firmly had he determined it, That all his Friends and Favorits had much ado to avert him from this purpoſe, nor could it be done, till the Citizens cauſed an Inſtrument in Writing to be drawn, and Ratified it with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seal, by which they <hi>Confeſſed their Rebellion, humbly craving Pardon, and without any reſtraint or exception ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their Lands, Goods, Lives, and the whole City, to the Kings Grace and Mercy:</hi> Whereupon paying 1000 Marks Fine, they were Reſtored to their Liberties and Cuſtoms, which had been ſeized into the Kings hands, during which ſpace they had ſuffered much dammage; yet for what Wrongs ſoever they received, they could find no Redreſs: And many Robberies and Piracies during the Wars being committed by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> to hinder his Courts of Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peſtered with many Complaints, he ordered they ſhould be heard in the Courts within the Juriſdiction of thoſe Ports; where the Perſons agrieved expecting little redreſs, becauſe the Inhabitants were parties, few Complaints after that were made.</p>

This Outrage made the King pronounce no leſs than utter Deſtruction to them. But the Prince and Kings Counſellours, fearing ſuch ſeverity might renew the <hi>Civil War</hi> as dangerous as ever, with much ado pacified him ſo far, that he Granted a Pardon to the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and all that had Acted in the late Tumult. Yet the Earl finding but cold Entertainment at Court, fearing ſome miſchief might befal him at home, Made it his requeſt to the King that he would ſend him with an Army to make War in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> This motion, tho' it tended to much charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, pleaſed the King well; for he conſidered if he continued at home he would ſtill be Plotting, but abroad he could little injure the quiet of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that an Army being raiſed, the Earl repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of his Undertaking, and feigned ſo many cauſes for delay, that the King took the Command out of his hand, and gave it to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> who Tranſported the Army into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and by his valorous Acts brought ſuch a Terror on the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sarazens,</hi> That they ſeldom, if they could avoid it, adventured themſelves againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in that Quarter where the Prince drew up; and the Terror of his coming made them raiſe the Siege of the City of <hi>Acon,</hi> which they had preſſed hardly for a long time, with 100000 Men; which made them ſecretly contrive his Death: For a <hi>Sarazen,</hi> under pretence of delivering him a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61951:234"/> Letter, Stabbed him in the Arm with an Impoiſoned Knife; whereupon the Prince ſtruck him down with his Foot, and upon the noiſe, his Guards coming in, cut the Villan in pieces; yet ſo deſperate was the Wound, by reaſon of the venom, that the Surgeons declared, That unleſs any at the hazard of their Lives would daily ſuck the Wound, to draw away the Poiſon, his Life could not be ſaved; this, when all his Courtiers ſtrained Courteſie to do, or utterly refuſed, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by <hi>Elianor</hi> his virtuous and loving Wife, Siſter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had accompanied him in that tedious Journey; and yet ſhe was not at all injured by it.</p>
                  <p>And now the King having had ſome Peace, was a little diſturbed by a Tumult in <hi>Norwich,</hi> who Burnt the <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> but he haſting thither, they diſperſed, yet eſcaped not ſo, for a ſtrict enquiry being made into the matter, 50 of the chief Actors were Drawn, Hanged and Quartered, and their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Burned. Soon after this, the King fell Sick, and Dyed at the Abby of St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> on the Sixteenth of <hi>November, Anno Dom.</hi> 1275, in the 57th Year of his Reign, and 65th of his Age.

                  <p>In this Kings Reign, an Impoſture at the <hi>Provincial Synod</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be Wounded in the Hands, Feet and Sides, ſaying he was <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and a Woman that went about with him called herſelf the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but being taken and cloſed up between two Walls, they there miſerably periſhed.</p>
                  <p>On St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day in the 15th Year of his Reign, ſuch an unuſual Thunder and Lightening happened, That whilſt <hi>Roger Niger</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was at Maſs, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, the Cathedral was ſo ſhaken, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple verily ſuppoſed it would have falln, and that they

In the 20th Year of the King, the <hi>Thames</hi> over-flowed its Banks, ſo that Boats were Rowed in the great Palace-Yard at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and alſo in the midſt of the Hall. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth wrote to the King, That he might have ſafe conduct to come and ſee <hi>England;</hi> but was denied, in conſideration it was thought he did it with an intent to Embroyl the Kingdom. In the 23d of the King a great Plague happened, conſuming 500000 People of all Degrees; and <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne</hi> with the Bridge, was conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fire; and two Years after, the Sea Flowed without any conſiderable Ebb, and in the Night by the fighting of the Waves ſeemed all on Fire; making a terrible Noiſe, which was heard many Miles. On the 43d of the Kings Reign a <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Tewksbury</hi> fell into a <hi>Privy</hi> on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> and refuſed to be helped out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was on their Sabbath; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the County, made him keep our <hi>Sunday</hi> there; when on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning he was found Dead.</p>

Soon after this King <hi>Edward,</hi> in Monumental Honour to his Queen, for the great Love ſhe had ſhewed in Sucking his Envenomed Wound, and accompanying him in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> where ſhe endured many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, raiſed Croſſes in the moſt Remarkable Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in <hi>England,</hi> with the Arms of <hi>Spain</hi> Quartered with thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and the Queens Statue in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the moſt Remarkable of them; and remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treacherous Practices of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him Abroad, and their always taking part with the <hi>Infidels</hi> againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he Baniſhed them out of <hi>England,</hi> to the Number of 15009 Perſons, Confiſcating their Goods; by which means, and Fining corrupt Judges and Officers, he repleniſhed his Treaſury with 236000 Marks. And about this time Dr. <hi>Scotus,</hi> called <hi>Subtilis,</hi> Preached againſt the Popes laying claim to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys, his abuſing the Epiſcopal Authority, as alſo that Tranſubſtantiation (which wild Notion had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced not long before) was contradictory to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common Reaſon; but the Popiſh Clergy ſoon Perſecuted him into ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Long had not the Peace continued between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> ere <hi>Llewelling</hi> by the raſh Perſwaſions and Incitement of his Brother <hi>David</hi> (a Man more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than Provident, and leſs Valiant than Mutinous, and yet one whom the King did extraordinarily love and favour) fell into Rebellion again, forgetting his Oath, which made him little proſper in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to enlarge his Borders; for after many ſharp Encounters with Sr. <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant on the Weſtern Marches, he and his Brother were taken, their Heads ſtruck off, and placed on the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> Yet their followers gave not over, but kept in Parties, Ravaging and Spoiling by Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61951:239"/> within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale, and then with their Booty retired again to their Woods and Faſtneſſes, where they had Builded Huts, as if they conceived this Trade would be of a long continuance, without ſhifting: But the King, not longer able to bear the Cries and Complaints of his ſuffering Subjects, Marched a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Army thither, but not finding the Enemy in the Field, to Ferret them out he cauſed the Woods to be cut down and conſumed with Fire; whereupon ſome ſubmitted, others dyed of Cold and Hunger in their Retreatments, and many of the Ringleaders were put to Death by ſundry manner of Executions; by which means they were reduced to a more ſociable kind of life, and began to practice divers commendable Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, Arts and Sciences, and took ſome pleaſure from thenceforth to live like Honeſt Men.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by a fall from his Horſe off a Cliff by the Seaſide (whither, upon ſome ſuddain Fright, he carried him furiouſly) breaking his Neck, and leaving no Male or Female Iſſue, his three Siſters, (the Eldeſt of which was Married to <hi>John Baliol</hi> Earl of <hi>Galloway,</hi> the Second to <hi>Robert Le Bruce,</hi> Lord of <hi>Valley Androw,</hi> and the Third to <hi>John Haſtings,</hi> Lord of <hi>Abergavennie,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Peer</hi>) laid claim to the Crown by their moſt powerful Friends; many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes paſſed, and Reaſonings about it; but theſe little availing, it came at laſt to the Sword, which for many Years made miſerable Havock in that Kingdom, each of the Competitors laying claim to the Crown in Right of their Wives, refering the Deciſion of their Cauſe to King <hi>Edward,</hi> under whoſe Ward they agreed to put the Government till matters could be determined; whereupon he paſſed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> attended with a conſiderable Army, there as Soveraign Lord to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Strife, and put the ſtate of Affairs in good
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61951:239"/> order. But ſuch was their mutual deſires to Reign, that no perſwaſions prevailed to make any one of them recede from his coveted Soveraignty; yet they all agreed by a publick Writing under their Hands and Seals to refer themſelves and their Titles to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Judgment of King <hi>Edward;</hi> and by the ſame Inſtrument ſurrendered the Crown and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affaires to him. To the end that thereby he might enable himſelf abſolutely to poſſeſs ſuch a one of them of the Kingdom, as in his Judgment ought to have the Regal Dignity conferred on him; and with the Writing he received their ſeveral Demands and Claims fairly drawn up, with the Proofs and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to maintain them: Whereupon he Summoned a Council of Twenty <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and as many <hi>Scotch</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, Prelates, and Lawyers, to conſider and adviſe what was moſt proper to be done in this great Affair; and when he had duly informed himſelf of the matter, and was well ſatisfied in his Conſcience about it, he gave the Definitive Sentence in favour of <hi>John Bailiol</hi> who had Married the Eldeſt of the Three Siſters, and he (upon doing Homage to King <hi>Edward</hi>) received from him the Crown and Government of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, the <hi>French</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the King over-buſied in ſo weighty a matter, and not altogether at leaſure to mind his own concerns, entered into <hi>Guyan, Gaſcoyne,</hi> and other his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries beyond the Seas, taking ſome Towns, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many Outrages on his Subjects, and their Poſſeſſions.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61951:240"/> Clergy, who for the moſt part having been exempted from the charge of former Wars, were grown very Rich; he demanded of them half the profit of their Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, ſeizing into his hands the uſeleſs or ſuperfluous Plate, Jewels, and Treaſure of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Abbies, Monaſteries, and other Religious Houſes and Places. This made them exceedingly murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and labour to Alienate the Hearts of his Subjects from him; tho' in ſome ſort he was not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to give them ſatisfaction, by promiſing reſtitution when his Treaſure ſhould by encreaſed; and tho' they little relied on ſuch a Promiſe, as thinking the King would at no time empty his own Coffers to repleniſh theirs, finding they ſhould be ſtript of their Treaſure without remedy, they found out another way, as they ſuppoſed, to make themſelves amends in time, though no great matter preſently could be expected from it.</p>
                  <p>There had been a Statute Enacted in the Fourth Year of his Reign, ſtrictly Prohibiting the giving and conveying Lands or Tenements to any Corporation whatſoever, called, <hi>The Statute againſt Mortmain,</hi> unleſs with the Kings conſent; and this ſtood in the way, eſpecially to hinder Perſons in their Wills, to bequeath any thing of that kind to the Church or Religious Houſes: This they prayed might be Revoked, But he Replyed, <hi>As of himſelf he could make no Laws, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of Parliament much leſs could he Annihilate them;</hi> (for he was honeſter than to pretend to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power) and tho' this vexed them inwardly to be fruſtrated of all that could be expected to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yet ſuch was the power he had gained ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whilſt the King was intent to go over and finiſh what had been ſo well begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on; the <hi>French</hi> King, as much as in him lay, to croſs his proceedings, had made a Faction in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the new King, who compelled him to renounce his Allegiance to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſend Defiance to him; nor was this all, but with an Army haſtily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, he entered and waſted the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> Slaying, Burning and Plundering without Pity or Remorſe: Whereupon King <hi>Edward,</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his manifold Favours, and the great love he had to the Revolted King of <hi>Scots;</hi> this baſe Ingratitude ſo ſtirred his Anger, That he reſolved a bloody cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement ſhould be the puniſhment of his unthankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Whereupon recalling ſome of his Forces, and raiſing more, he Marched to the ſuccour of his Subjects; and ſuch was his good Fortune, that in a little time he met with and fought the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, ſlaying 25000 of them, winning the ſtrong Caſtles of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and ſoon after the City of <hi>Edenburough,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of note; which made King <hi>John</hi> too late
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61951:241"/> ſee his Errors, and to what diſtreſs his raſhneſs had driven him: However, thinking to find Favour by an humble ſubmiſſion, or at leaſt prevent the further Ruin and Deſolation of his Country, he came and caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at King <hi>Edwards</hi> Feet, wholle ſubmitting, with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be at his diſpoſe, in expectation to have been Reſtored; but King <hi>Edward,</hi> reſenting very heinouſly his ungrateful proceedings, ſent him under a ſtrong Guard to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> yet ordered him allowance of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Diet, and Attendance, as became his ſtate; when Marching from Sea to Sea, without any farther reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he ſettled the Affaires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> committing the Government of the Kingdom to <hi>John Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> as his Lieutenant; Conſtituting <hi>Hugh Creſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and <hi>William Barnſley</hi> his Chief Juſtice; confining ſome of the Rebellious <hi>Scots</hi> within the Marches of <hi>England,</hi> that they might be diſabled from giving any Diſturbance in his Abſence; and ſo returned in Triumph, with great Honours, and high applauſe of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The King being now at leaſure to remember the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries the <hi>French</hi> had done him, and reſolving to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them, Leagued with <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Tranſported an Army thither, and Fought with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Arthois,</hi> whome he Routed, taking many Towns and Fortreſſes on the Frontiers; which made the <hi>French</hi> King play over the game again of ſtirring up the <hi>Scots</hi> to Rebellion, hoping by that means to conſtrain him to return; but on the contrary, he appointed <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> his General for that War; who mannaged it with that Prudence, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Marching, Training them into the open Field, he gave them Battel with incredible Slaughter, ſo that many Miles of Ground were in a manner covered with
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61951:241"/> their dead Bodies, by which great Overthrow they found themſelves conſtrained to return to their former Obedience; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> King perceiving his Project took not on that ſide, ſeemed very deſirous to try his Strength with King <hi>Edward</hi> in the Field; but his Courage failing, he repoſing more confidence in his Policy than Valour, he proceeded to tamper about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Love and Amity, that might ſettle a laſting Peace; and King <hi>Edward</hi> being now a Widower, he earneſtly ſolicited him to take his Siſter to Wife, to make the Alliance ſtronger; which by the cunning ſubtilty of ſome Courtiers, Bribed by the <hi>French</hi> King, was brought about; and Peace enſued after a tedious War that had cauſed much Bloodſhead. So the King with his Queen returned home, and ſoon after he made Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, who had been Born at <hi>Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> the better to ingratiate himſelf with thoſe People, Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and to gain the Hearts of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> he reſtored them thoſe Liberties his Father had deprived them of, and without which they had continued the ſpace of Twelve Years; during which time a Governour was ſet over them by the King, and their Magiſtrates choſen by his order. But whilſt things were well ordering at home, the <hi>Scots</hi> again fell into Rebellion: Whereupon the King ſent to demand their Ring-leaders, who had drawn them into this danger, (which principally was one <hi>Wallis,</hi> a Gentleman of an inveterate Spirit againſt the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi>) with a promiſe of Pardon to all the reſt, upon their laying down their Arms; or elſe threatned to waſte the Country with Fire and Sword from Sea to Sea, and ſpare none of that Nation he ſhould find in his way. But driven on by their hard Fate, they were Deaf to theſe Propoſals, making yet greater preparations to weather (as they thought) the Storm
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61951:242"/> they could not but expect; and ſo upon the Kings entering the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they bid him Battel; where, before the Armies joyned, he made them the ſame Offers, which they ſeemed to reject with ſcorn; ſo the Bloody Blaſt being ſounded by the order of the Incenſed King, who reſolved now to Scourge them in earneſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fell on with ſuch fury and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that they broke, like a Tempeſt, into the <hi>Scots</hi> Battel, carrying all before them, ſo that a miſerable ſlaughter enſued, and the King preſſing too furiouſly upon thoſe that Fled, in the eagerneſs of the Purſuit, fell from his Horſe, and broke two of his Ribs; yet he lightly remounting, and not regarding his Hurt, drove them out of the Field with the ſlaughter of 32000 of them; he not now (as at other times) reſtraining the Swords of his Soldiers, but gave ſcope and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their thirſt of Revenge, and in this Battel fell the flower of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility and Gentry; but on our ſide very few were ſlain; ſome Hiſtorians make mention but of 28 of all Degrees, tho' that ſeemes too Partial. But in compariſon of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they were certainly very inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>The Priſoners that were taken were not many, by reaſon few were ſpared in the Fight, or in the purſuit that were overtaken; ſo that the ſmall remainder of the Nobles came and Humbled themſelves before the King, charging the fault on ſuch as they ſaid had juſtly received their Deſerts by being ſlain in the Battel; and this Submiſſion, upon their taking a new Oath of Fealty and Homage, was accepted; and returning home, upon the earneſt requeſt of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, he Releaſed <hi>John</hi> the Depoſed King of <hi>Scots</hi> out of the Tower, who went to <hi>Normandy</hi> to live quietly there on Lands alotted him, called <hi>Bayliolls</hi> Lordſhip or Lands; where falling Blind, and being much in Years,

                  <p>As ſoon as King <hi>Edward</hi> was returned from his Journey, he cauſed an Enquiry (which was termed <hi>Troli Baſton</hi>) to be made in all his Dominions of the Miſdemeanors and Oppreſſions of his Officers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that the Number of the Tranſgreſſors were ſo many, that heavy Fines being laid on them, and they like ſo many full Spunges Squeezed of their Unjuſt Gains into the Kings Coffers, they were plentifully repleniſhed thereby; not only to Pay off old Debts, but to Recompence ſuch as had at their own Expence faithfully Served him in his Wars; and among other Complaints, Dr. <hi>Langton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> Exhibited one to the King againſt Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he ſaid at the Inſtigation of <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> his Looſe and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61951:243"/> Evil Counſellor, had forcibly broken into his Parks, wounded his Servants, and deſtroyed his Game: Whereupon the Prince was committed to Priſon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Kings pleaſure, and <hi>Gaveſton</hi> Baniſhed upon pain of Death, never to return into the Land; and <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Son to <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> Dying without Iſſue, he gave that Earldom to Prince <hi>Edward;</hi> which Title, with that of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> have been ſince inſeparable from the Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Peace being now had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> things remained quiet for a time; during which ſpace, <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> one of the Competitors, came with divers Nobles to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and was highly Entertained; which they did only for a ſhew, whilſt they were dealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand with the Pope to favour their Cauſe; nor was he ſlow in it, but ſent an Inſtrument in Writing by which he pretended to lay claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as holden of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein King <hi>Edward</hi> was peremptorily required to ſurceaſe from all Demands of Tenure and Soveraignty over it. But he ſtoutly Anſwered by his Ambaſſadors, That it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and not unto the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any other; requiring him to revoke his unjuſt Claim, for that both he and his Nobles were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to maintain his Right therein at the hazard of their Lives and Eſtates; and the Ambaſſador ſhewing the Hands and Seals of the Nobles, and moſt of the Prelates of <hi>England,</hi> that had Sworn to this Reſolution; the old Blade with the Leaden Sword drew in his Horns; whereupon <hi>Bruce</hi> ſecretly withdrew and raiſed Tumults in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Yet the King forced him to fly into <hi>Norway,</hi> where he remained; till in <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds Reign he returned to broach new Troubles.

                  <p>
                     <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Second Succeeded his Father in the Throne; but having been brought up tenderly, and given too much to Flatterers and looſe Company,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61951:246"/> he very early gave the Nobles cauſe to diſtaſt his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for tho' his Father in his Laſt Will had ſtrictly Prohibited his Recalling <hi>Peirce Gaveſton</hi> from Baniſhment, a Perſon who by his evil Example and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Counſels had been the great Debaucher of his Younger Years, yet he did it, tho' contrary to the Mind of his People in general; and to deſpite them the more, took him into his particular Favour, Vowing if it lay in his power he would willingly ſhare the Kingdom with him, heaping Honours on him, and Liberally opening his Coffers to him; ſo that he no ſooner asked, but his deſires were granted. This much perplexed the Nobles, and made them Remonſtrate to the King the ill conſequences that were likely to follow on ſuch his Proceedings, putting him in mind of his dying Fathers charge to him, and urging many other things; but he little regarded them; ſo that perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King entirely to doat on this upſtart Favourite, who thereupon grew very Proud and Inſolent, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to the Barony of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> making him Maſter of his Jewels and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a great part of which he ſent beyond the Seas, to provide for himſelf againſt ſuch a Storm as he might reaſonably expect, They for a time held their peace; tho' they inwardly grieved at the Miſcarriage of things.</p>
                  <p>The King was now Married to <hi>Iſabel</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, a Lady of admirable Beauty, but of a haughty Mind, impatient of Injuries; yet this Looſe Favourite, to croſs her, becauſe he ſtood not high in her eſteem, laboured by introducing freſh Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the King, to Alienate him from her Society and Bed, carried him often to Revellings, and made him Drink to Exceſs, that his Conſcience might not find any deliberate time to Check him for his Lawleſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes.</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:61951:247"/>
                  <p>The Queen at this was both Grieved and Angry, labouring however, by all mild ways and endearing perſwaſions to Reclaim the King, laying before him his Unkindneſs to one that ſo tenderly Loved and Honoured him, and the Scandal and Contempt he would cauſe of himſelf among his People, if he who was placed in ſo eminent a Station, to give good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others, as Patterns for them to follow, ſhewed in himſelf ſuch an evil one; Intreating him to follow the Prudence and Heroick Virtues of his Father, and not deſpiſing the ſober Advice of his Grave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, harken to and be lead away by baſe Paraſites and Flatterers. But the King, not regarding what ſhe ſaid, tho' the People at the ſame time greatly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and ſpoke evil of him for his Looſe and Un-Princely manner of Living, as alſo of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> to whom they bore an irreconcileable hatred: The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles found themſelves conſtrained (for redreſſing theſe Miſchiefs) and preventing greater, that threatened the Kingdom, To Petition the King for <hi>Gaveſton</hi>'s Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein they ſet forth his evil Practices and Faults, with the Sorrow of his Majeſties beſt affected Subjects, for that he (more than was fit or comely) was Guided and Governed by that unworthy Favourite; earneſtly entreating his Highneſs he would be pleaſed (for preventing ſuch Miſchiefs as were otherwiſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enſue) To Baniſh that Lewd Perſon from his Court and Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The King upon this, fearing ſome danger threatned if he refuſed to comply with his Nobles, whom he found reſolutely bent no longer to ſuffer ſuch Indignities as <hi>Gaveſton</hi> had put upon them; tho' much againſt his will, agreed he ſhould be ſent into <hi>Ireland;</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was done; yet the King ſent after him many comfortable Meſſages, and at length conſtituted him

                  <p>The King had no ſooner notice of the untimely end of his Favourite, but in a vehement paſſion he Curſed thoſe Noblemen, and expreſſed his Anger and Vows of Revenge in many threatning terms: But Time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him cooler, and the Reaſons that were given for their haſty Proceedings, he Pardoned them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that all which belonged to <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> ſhould be put into his hands. However his inclinations were ſuch that he could not be long without a Favourite, to whom he might impart his Secrets on all occaſions; wherefore he made Sr. <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> his Son, of his Cabinet Council; raiſing them from a mean Eſtate, to Lord it over the Nobles; and whatever he did of any importance, was by their Advice and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; he made the Elder of them Earl of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and gave to both of them many Honourable Places and Offices, which cauſed them to become more Inſolent than <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and altogether as much hated in a little time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing Reign, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice of theſe Diſorders in <hi>England,</hi> thought it was now a fit time for him to poſſeſs himſelf of the Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and therefore returning from <hi>Norway,</hi> he was Joyfully received by the <hi>Scots,</hi> as well Nobles as Commons; and was by them a ſecond time Crowned King; whereupon he Levied a great Army, and entered into the <hi>Engliſh Marches,</hi> miſerably waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country as he paſſed, with Fire and Sword; which made King <hi>Edward</hi> ſhake off his ſoft repoſe, and haſten to the Field; whoſe coming put a ſtop to the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61951:249"/> torent, and made the <hi>Scots</hi> retire beyond the <hi>Tweed.</hi> Whereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> having ſtrengthened his Army, entered <hi>Scotland,</hi> doing great Damage; but was at <hi>Bannocks Bourn</hi> Encountered by King <hi>Robert,</hi> who Surpriſingly fell upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of their remiſſneſs, and the unwillingneſs of ſome of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to Engage, becauſe King <hi>Edward</hi> had given the great Commands into the hands of mean Perſons by the Advice of the <hi>Spencers;</hi> and after a bloody and long Fight, totally Routed them. And here King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> through bad conduct, having been a Spectator of the ſlaughter of many Valiant Men, (among which were <hi>Gilbert D' Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and 42 other Lords, with more than 60 Knights and Baronets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 22 of Note, who were taken Priſoners) he was compelled for his own ſafety to haſten back for <hi>England</hi> (leaving all his Treaſure, Amunition and Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and 22000 common Soldiers Slain and made Priſoners) exceedingly diſconſolated and perplexed; where he ſoon found new Troubles: For one <hi>John Poldras,</hi> a Tanners Son of <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> boldly affirming himſelf to be the truly begotten Son of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Firſt, aledging that he was changed by his Nurſe in his Cradle for a <hi>Carters</hi> Child, raiſed by this Chimera ſtrange Commotions, many People believing by King <hi>Edwards</hi> proceedings, ſo diſagreeable to thoſe of the preceding King, that there was ſome ground of truth in it. He alſo offered divers colourable Proofs for what he ſaid, and among others he ſtrongly inſiſted on the unworthy and ſordid conditions of the King, ſorting to none ſo fitly as to one of obſcure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Birth; ſo that a great many of the Commons in thoſe parts unadviſedly flocked to him, and owned him for their True King, looking on <hi>Edward</hi> as a Changling; but they in a hot Skirmiſh being Defeated,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61951:250"/> the Impoſtor was taken Priſoner, and confeſſed his Treaſon and Folly, but not any one that ſet him on work, and encouraged him to it; ſo that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by his Confeſſion, he was Condemned and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and the reſt Pardoned; which at this time put an end to the Weſtern Troubles.</p>
                  <p>But in the North, the <hi>Scots</hi> purſuing theis Succeſs, taking many Places Gariſoned with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by force, and had the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Berwick</hi> betrayed into their hands by the Deputy-Governor, who let them in, in the dusk of the Evening, at a Sally-Port he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely left open; yet in the dark ſcuffle he had his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for going with the appointed Signal of ſafety, and in the dark, it not being diſcerned by the <hi>Scots,</hi> they Slew him.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this all the miſery at this time the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern County ſuffered, their Cattle Dyed of a grievous Murrain, and Famine was exceeding amongſt them. Moreover divers notorious Thieves and Robbers (to the number of 200) taking the advantage of theſe ſtirs, put themſelves into Friars Weeds, and Robbed, Ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Burned, and laid Waſte where they came, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering divers who Reſiſted them; but in a few Months moſt of them were taken and put to Death by ſundry Torments. The Famine was likewiſe ſucceeded by a Plague; ſo that the Living were ſcarce able to Bury the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Calamities and daily cries of his People made the King advance Northward with an Army; yet bad ſucceſs attended him, for giving the <hi>Scots</hi> Battel, he was Overthrown, and a great part of his Army Slain; and ſo in much vexation returned home. This made the Nobles grievouſly complain of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> and others, the Kings Favourites, by whoſe bad Mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affaires the Realm was at a point to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61951:250"/> in Miſery, laying before the King their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours and ill treatment of his Subjects; how many Thouſands ſuffered by the Male-Adminiſtration of Government, and the great Callamities approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if ſpeedy Redreſs was not had, even to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the State; and then became Importunate Suitors to him, that he would be pleaſed to put thoſe from him that had cauſed ſo many Grievances, and made him careleſs of thoſe Duties which by Almighty God were required at his hands. They told him likewiſe, As Subjection belonged to the People, ſo the King was bound to Protect them; and that moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably he had left his Commons in the North a Prey to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and grievouſly oppreſſed with Wants and Extremities; and that if he pleaſed not (upon their humble Entreaty and Requeſt) to diſmiſs the <hi>Spencers</hi> from their Places and Service, They muſt and would preſume to do it, tho' with the hazard and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their own Lives.</p>
                  <p>At this, tho' the King in Conſcience could not but hearken to it, being an apparent Truth, yet it ſo highly diſpleaſed him (who preferred his Favourites before the Good of all his People) That he bit his Lip, and with an auſtere Countenance turned at firſt from them, without ſpeaking; but conſidering the ill conſequences that might attend his ſlighting them in a buſineſs wherein all his good Subjects were concerned, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again, and gave them a pleaſing Anſwer, <hi>viz. That ſince things were come to ſuch extremity, there could be no ſuitable Redreſs but in a Parliament, which he ſpeedily intended to call, and would ſubmit to what that Aſſembly ſhould determine moſt Neceſſary for the good and wellfare of the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the Nobles afterward ſeemed diſſatisfied, as fancying the King (when they were ſo Aſſembled)
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61951:251"/> deſigned to Seiz them, and forcibly make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Terms; yet finding ſuch a meeting was neceſſary, they came ſtrongly Guarded with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Train, all in one Livery; this much ſtartled the King, but moſt of all it grieved him he now ſaw he muſt part with the <hi>Spencers,</hi> whom in the Extaſie of his Expreſſions he had declared to Love dearer than his Queen or Children; and accordingly they were Baniſhed during their Lives, the King being bound not to Recal them upon any pretence whatever. But this cauſed a hatred in him againſt the Barons, ſo that he expreſſed it in Threats, and that he ought not to be forced to do any thing againſt his Mind. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Younger <hi>Spencer,</hi> geting a Squadron of Ships turned Pirate, Robbing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants and Strangers, The King would not conſent to their Intreaties that a Fleet might be ſent out to ſurpreſs thoſe apparent Injuries and Diſgraces, but Laughed at them when they propoſed it, as inwardly pleaſed at the News they had brought him; and ſoon after, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectation of all Men, Recalled them from Baniſhment, reſtoring them to their Honours and Offices, wherein they became more Inſolent than ever.</p>
                  <p>The Barons grieved at theſe Proceedings, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no Redreſs from the King, immediatly took up Arms, and the King did the like; ſo that after many ſharp Bickerings and Encounters, both Armies joyned in Battel, and Fought cruelly; <hi>Kindred</hi> againſt <hi>Kindred,</hi> making no diſtinction of Relations, in the bloody Field: But when many of the Barons and other Leaders were Slain, their Party gave way, and the King Purſued very furiouſly, ſo that a miſerable Slaughter happened, and at <hi>Burrow-Bridge,</hi> near where this Battel was Fought, The Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (the Kings Unkle) and 90 other Nobles were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61951:251"/> and ſent to <hi>Pontfract-Caſtle,</hi> where the Noble Earl ſtaid on a Scaffold Seven Hours before they could procure an Executioner to Behead him, ſo greatly was he Beloved by all ſorts of People; but at length a vile Wretch was procur'd out of a Goal, for a ſum of Money, to perform that Office. Five others were put to Death there, and at <hi>York</hi> the next day the Lords <hi>Clifford, Mobray</hi> and <hi>Derwell</hi> were Hanged in Iron-Chaines. The Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> likewiſe loſt his Head; in all (at ſeveral places) Twenty Noblemen; ſo that in no Reign ſo much Noble Blood, by Executions, wet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Earth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe terrible Executions aſtoniſhed the reſt, and broke their Strength, which greatly puffed up the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> by whoſe Inſtigation, more than any cruel incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the King, it was thought to be done, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their own State, which after this they imagined could not be ſhaken: For ſoon after, ſome Courtiers Intreating the King for the Life of a Perſon of mean Rank, who had committed a Murther, he broke out into a violent Paſſion in theſe words, <hi>viz. A Plague overtake you all, for Flatering Knaves; you make much Suit for the Life of an errand Caitiff, but which of you ſpoke a word for the good Knight Lord</hi> Thomas <hi>my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle? By the Bread of God this Varlet ſhall Dye the Death he deſerves;</hi> and ſo in a Rage he turned from them, and ſoon after he called a Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> in which Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son was Created Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of <hi>Aquitain;</hi> and Sir <hi>Andrew Harkly,</hi> whoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Service was a principal means of the Barons Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, Earl of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> and demanded the Sixth Penny of all Temporalities in <hi>England, Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to defray the Charges of his intended War againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> which he obtained; yet the People grievouſly Murmured at Paying it, affirming they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61951:252"/> Impoveriſhed by the late Wars and Famine.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Scots</hi> geting ſecret Inteligence of what the King intended againſt them, reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin firſt, and well knowing they had Impoveriſhed the Northern parts, and that no further Booty was there to be had, they croſſed over the Narrow Straights, and fell very furiouſly on <hi>Ireland;</hi> but by the Courage and prudent Conduct of the Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brinningham,</hi> they were Overthrown, their King Slain, and moſt of them Cut in Pieces; upon this advantage, King <hi>Edward</hi> Marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he found full of Terror and Confuſion, the People every where flying before him into the Woods, Mountains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faſtneſſes; thinking by that means to weary out the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and indeed their Project failed not, for Snows, Rains, and bitter Froſts enſuing, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were unable to keep the Field, eſpecially their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions being near ſpent, and a great Mortality (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the raw Damps and Colds) grievouſly afflicted the Camp; ſo that, contrary to the mind of the King, they were forced to return; which the <hi>Scots</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crept from their lurking Holes, and carried Fire a croſs, which is the uſual Signal for the Alarum, or raiſing the Country, and ſoon gathered into ſuch Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, that following and waſting his Rear, at laſt they boldly ſet on his main Battel and diſcomfited it; ſo that he was conſtrained to fly, and leave them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Treaſure, and Baggage. This Defeat is ſaid to be occaſioned by the Treachery of Sr. <hi>Andrew Harkley,</hi> who had been lately Created Earl of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> who being Bribed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> betraied his truſt in the Battel. But however it happened, it was charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and for it he loſt his Head.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Kings return, there happened a Quarrel between the Queen and the <hi>Spencers;</hi> ſhe charging

                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope alſo, and chiefeſt Cardinals, being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by great Rewards, ſtrictly required the <hi>French</hi> King, upon pain of the Apoſtolick Curſe, to ſend home the Queen and Prince, ſo that ſhe perceiving he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deliver her into the hands of ſuch as would have Forcibly brought her over, ſhe ſecretly retired with her Son into the <hi>Empire;</hi> however during her ſtay at the <hi>French Court,</hi> ſhe had done <hi>England</hi> a kindneſs, in cauſing by her Mediation the Troubles in <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> to ceaſe; and making an Agreement in other matters relating to the King her Husband: In conſideration
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61951:253"/> of which, he was to confer the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Poictou</hi> on the Prince his Son, which he did, under his Seal; and he did Homage for it to his Unkle the <hi>French</hi> King; but upon his ſending for her home, ſhe refuſed to come, unleſs hers and others Grievances were Redreſſed by Parliament; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned his trying by other means to make her return; but as is ſaid, ſhe retiring into the <hi>Empire,</hi> upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of what was Intended, went to <hi>Hainalt,</hi> where ſhe was kindly received; and to make her Intereſt ſtrong at that Court, ſhe without the conſent of her Husband, or the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> Married the Prince to <hi>Phillipa,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hainalts</hi> Daughter; upon which account, and the means of what Treaſure ſhe had brought, ſhe raiſed 2700 Soldiers, Commanded by Sr. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hainalt,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Beamont,</hi> to whom Joyned the Young Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> who had eſcaped out of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and got beyond the Seas, with ſome other Exiled <hi>Engliſh</hi> Noblemen and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that having all things in a readineſs, ſhe Sayled for <hi>England,</hi> and Landed at <hi>Orwell</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> whither a great Number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſorted to her; and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe went, her Army greatly encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> having notice of this, left his Court, and retired haſtily into the Weſt to raiſe Forces; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing 1000<hi>l.</hi> to any that ſhould bring him the Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Head; The King was no ſooner retired, but the <hi>Londoners</hi> taking the Advantage of his Abſence, ſeized upon the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who was appointed to Govern the City, and without any Legal Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Judicial Sentence, cauſed his Head to be ſtricken off at the Standard in <hi>Cheapſide;</hi> and then with great violence broke down the <hi>Tower</hi> Gates, killing all they found in it, and ſecured that and the City to the uſe of the Queen, and of the Prince her Son.</p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:61951:253"/>
                  <p>The King being Informed of theſe Proceedings, his Heart failed him; ſo that deſiſting from his intent of raiſing Forces, he Poſted to <hi>Briſtol</hi> and Fortified it, committing the Defence thereof to the Earl of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and the <hi>Spencer</hi>'s, Father and Son, entered with him into the Caſtle, which they determined as a laſt Refuge to defend with all their Strength; but within a few days after, the City was Beſieged, Aſſaulted and Taken by the Queen and Barons, who took and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Earl and divers others of Note to ſafe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody; the King and his two Favourites diſpairing of Safety there, got out to Sea in a ſmall Fiſher Boat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for <hi>Ireland;</hi> but ſo Providence ordered it, that it was thrice (when put out) driven by the ſhifting of the Wind near the Caſtle; ſo that the laſt time the Lord <hi>Beamont</hi> Manning out a Veſſel ſeized it, and found there the King and the Elder <hi>Spencer,</hi> the other having got on Shore, and ſhifted away for a time: Theſe the Queen preſented before the Caſtle, which the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon no ſooner perceived, but they Surrendered; and here the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> was Beheaded, and the King ſent Priſoner to <hi>Kenelworth</hi> Caſtle; and by the way they contrived to Shave him, to Diſguiſe him, leaſt being known he ſhould be Reſcued; when the Impudent Fellow of a Shaver ſet him on a Molehill, and told him <hi>That Cold Water muſt now ſerve his turn,</hi> pointing to the Ditch; at which Indignity, the King burſt out in Tears, ſaying, <hi>There ſhould be Warm Water whether he would or no.</hi> The Queen having thus far proceeded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Death of her Capital Enemy, dooming him to be Quartered Alive; which was done, and his Head and Quarters ſet up in divers places; ſhe gave a conſiderable Reward to the Perſon who brought her the Head. Young <hi>Spencer,</hi> ſoon after was taken with the Lords <hi>Baldock</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> carried to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61951:254"/> Hanged on a Gallows 50 Foot high: And thus fell theſe Favourites, who put too much truſt in their own Strength and Pollicy, little expecting ſuch ſuddain turns of Fortune to alter their conditions, by throwing them from the Pinacle of Honour into the Gulf of Miſery and Diſgrace, which ought to be a Warning to all who undeſervedly aſpire, cautiouſly to behave themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, a Parliament was called to ſettle the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Affaires of the Kingdom, who Reſolved to transfer the Crown from <hi>Edward</hi> to his Son; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon three Biſhops, three Earls, two Barons, two Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and two Juſtices, were appointed to demand (in the Name of the Parliament) a ſurrender of it; which if he refuſed, they would perhaps take other meaſures and give it from his Family, to one more worthy. This he took ſo grievouſly, that after many complainings of his hard Uſage, and a confeſſion of his Failures in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he fell in a Swoon, which moved the Lords to pitty him; but being brought to himſelf, after ſome time bemoaning his hard Fate, ſeeing there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy, he Signed and Sealed the Inſtrument tendered him, by which he paſſed over his Crown, and Right and Title to all his Dominions, to Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son; whereupon Sr. <hi>William Truſſel,</hi> one of the Judges or Juſtices, in the name of the whole Realm, renounced Homage to the King in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>For theſe Wicked and Treaſonable Practices he was Tryed and Condemned, and afterward Hanged at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where he remained Hanging unpittied for two Days.

                  <p>In the Fifth Year of the Kings Reign <hi>Philip D' Valois,</hi> who Succeeded <hi>Charles</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Throne, required him to come over and pay Homage and Fealty for his Dutchey of <hi>Guyan,</hi> and accordingly he went, and was kindly entertained till he refuſed to do it by any more Ceremony than Words; but that not being Accepted, he returned to <hi>England,</hi> and upon a Second Summons ſent it in Writing under the Great Seal, which was not looked on as ſufficient; yet this ſubmiſſion diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, who told him he ought not to pay any Homage, for as much as the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in Right of his Mother properly belonged to him, and thus ſtated his Title, <hi>viz.

                  <p>This the King conſidered prudently, and deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with Grave Counſel about it, who all concluded it was his undoubted Right; and the Earl of <hi>Arthois</hi> (who fled out of <hi>France</hi> for ſaying (upon the <hi>French</hi> Kings Sentencing his Earldom to <hi>Maud</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Burgundy) By me was he made a King, and by me ſhall he be Depoſed</hi>) vehemently ſolicited the King to claim and proſecute his Right, promiſing him his Intereſt to make him many Friends even in the Heart of <hi>France:</hi> But this was laid aſide a while, by reaſon of a difference ariſing between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> For King <hi>Edward</hi> ſending to <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> King, who had Married his Siſter, to reſtore the Caſtle of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and do him Homage for his Kingdom, he Anſwered, <hi>That by the Sword he had won the Caſtle, and would keep it; and as for the Homage demanded, his Father never acknowledged any ſuch Service; and if he had, King</hi> Edward <hi>had releaſed it, if any ſuch was due; and therefore he would not confeſs any Tenure of the Crown of</hi> England.</p>

                  <p>And now he had leaſure to conſider how to poſſeſs himſelf of the <hi>French</hi> Diadem; and the firmer to bind the Earl of <hi>Arthois</hi> to his Intereſt, he created him Duke of <hi>Richmond;</hi> and to carry on the thing ſecretly till it ſhould be ripe for execution, The King by private Meſſages craved the Advice of the Earl of <hi>Hanialt</hi> his Wives Father, the Lord <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and others, who had great Intereſt in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who all approved it, promiſing their beſt aſſiſtance; and that he might have power to command the Nobles and Common People of thoſe Countries when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, They procured him to be created Vicar General of the <hi>Empire.</hi>

                  <p>Matters being thus Reſolved on and Forwarded, he Sailed to <hi>Flanders</hi> with his Queen, where he met and Conferred with a great many Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who agreed to aſſiſt him; and returning, raiſed an Army of 27000 Men, with which he Landed in <hi>France;</hi> and to oppoſe him, the <hi>French</hi> King took the Field with an Army of double the Number; but when they were ready to joyn in Battel, <hi>Jone</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Hainalt,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Mother to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by her unwearied Mediation ſtaid their forward Swords, by procuring a Twelvemonths Truce; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>French</hi> King diſſolved his Army, and King <hi>Edward</hi> with his returned to <hi>England:</hi> Yet he gave not over his Deſign, for going to <hi>Bruſſells</hi> after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truce, the <hi>German</hi> Princes firmly Engaged themſelves to his Intereſt, and ſolicited the <hi>Flemings</hi> to Confederate in the League; but they excuſed it, unleſs the King would ſtile himſelf King of <hi>France,</hi> and quarter the Arms of that Kingdom with his own, That ſo he might be impowered to releaſe unto them a Bond of Two Millions of Florins wherein they ſtood obliged not to wage War againſt the King of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe things he actually did; and then they conſorted with the <hi>German</hi> Princes who Signed and Sealed an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be True to King <hi>Edwards</hi> Intereſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he returned to <hi>England,</hi> to make ſpeedy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the War; and found that in his Abſence the <hi>French</hi> Squadrons had Burnt <hi>Southampton,</hi> and Ravaged <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and part of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> carrying away much Booty; but not doubting they ſhould one day pay dear

                  <p>After this great Victory, with inconſiderable Loſs
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61951:266"/> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the King laid Siege to <hi>Callis;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, tho' he made ſome ſhews with a great Army to Relieve it, defending the Paſſes, ſtopt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring; the Beſieged were Summoned and threatned if they Surrendered not immediately to expect no Mercy; they Capitulated, but their Terms offered was not accepted, they obſtinately reſiſted ſo long, that being brought to extremity the King would not accept of their Submiſſion then tendered, unleſs ſix of their chief Inhabitants would preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in their Shirts, with Halters about their Necks, and deliver up the Keys, which was done, when forthwith he commanded them to be Hanged, but at the entreaty of the Queen and Nobles they were ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this Siege laſted, <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> with an Army of 50000 Men entered <hi>England,</hi> and did great miſchief; but the Queen being then at home, gave him Battel with an Army of 12000, and gave the <hi>Scots</hi> a fatal Overthrow: King <hi>David</hi> was there taken Priſoner by one <hi>John Copeland,</hi> who refuſed to deliver him to the Queen, as claiming him his Priſoner by the Right of War, till going over to the King he deſired him to do it, and for his good Service ſettled on him 500<hi>l. per Annum</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and made him a Squire of his Body; whereupon King <hi>David</hi> was committed Priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having appointed Sr. <hi>Andrew D' Pavie</hi> a <hi>Lombard,</hi> Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> and turned out the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants, returned to <hi>England;</hi> but upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate notice the Governour (for a great Sum) deſigned to betray it to the Lord <hi>Cherney</hi> Captain of Arrays, he went over and was received in the dusk of the Evening; he prevented it by ſurpriſing that Lord and his Soldiers when they had partly entered, and the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61951:266"/> reſt waited for admittance. Yet in this Fight the King Encountering hand to hand with <hi>Euſtace</hi> of <hi>Ribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> was by him twice ſtooped on his Knees, but ſcorning to yield, he advanced with ſuch fury and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ſtrength, that he beat him down and took him Priſoner; but having experienced him to be a Valiant Knight, he ſoon releaſed him without Ranſom. About this time King <hi>Philip</hi> Dyed, and <hi>John</hi> his Son was Crowned, and the <hi>Calicians</hi> took the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Guyens,</hi> and the King, upon the obſtinacy of the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> in refuſing to Aid him, removed the Marts to <hi>Callis,</hi> ſettling there the Woollen Manufacture; ſo that by the Priviledges and Imunities granted to Artificers, happy was he that in a few Years could obtain the Kings leave to go over.</p>
                  <p>Soon after Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> Sirnamed for his valour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deeds the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> Landed an Army in <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coine,</hi> ſoon ſubduing the greater part of that Province, which made the <hi>French</hi> King haſten thither with a very numerous Army; and tho' he was ſix to one againſt the Prince, the Battel was Fought near <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archers put the <hi>French</hi> Horſe into ſuch confuſion at the firſt onſet, that they fell into Rout, and diſordered all the Squadrons that were to ſupport them; however the Battel where the <hi>French</hi> King fought valiantly, ſtood manfully to it a conſiderable time, but ſuch was the prevailing valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> That King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> his Younger Son were taken Priſoners, many Thouſands Slain, and the reſt put to Flight. The Fight being over, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> treated his Royal Priſoners with all Gentleneſs and Humility, cheering up their drooping Spirits, attending at the Kings Table, Lodged him in his own Bed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him Honourable Attendance, inſomuch that he confeſſed, <hi>He rather fancied himſelf at his own Court,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61951:267"/> than a Priſoner, by having met with ſo Courteous an Enemy:</hi> From hence he was conducted to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and ſo into <hi>England,</hi> where he was Entertained with the like civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and reſpect by the King and Queen; and beſides theſe, and what Nobles were Slain, there were taken 17 Earls, 51 Barons, and a great Number of Knights and Gentlemen; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers throughout the Army that had feweſt, being poſſeſſed of two Priſoners, and moreover the rich Spoiles of exceeding value were divided amongſt them; and a Truce was concluded for two Years. In the mean while the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had been Ten Years a Priſoner, was Releaſed at the Ranſom of 100000<hi>l.</hi> to be Paid in Five Years, and upon taking his Oath not to bear Arms againſt <hi>England,</hi> nor be Aiding to any other in doing it; and further, he acknowledged Homage and Fealty for his Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to King <hi>Edward.</hi> And propoſing to the <hi>French</hi> King his Ranſom, with Articles to be ſigned on his Enlargement, he ſent them to <hi>Charles</hi> his Eldeſt Son, who was Regent in his abſence, and to the Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> who utterly diſliking the Conditions, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Invade King <hi>Edwards</hi> Terretories, to compel him to more eaſie Terms; but not to be behind hand with them, he paſſed to <hi>Callis</hi> with an Army, taking the <hi>Black Prince</hi> along with him, and ſo waſted the Countries with Fire and Sword, taking many ſtrong Towns and Caſtles, that they became humble Suitors to him for a Peace, and ſubmitted to his Terms; ſo that after a ſhort Treaty, Articles were Agreed on, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>King, for his Ranſom, ſhould Pay King</hi> Edward 500000l. <hi>and not Aid any King of</hi> Scots <hi>in any War or Rebellion againſt</hi> England; <hi>and That King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>ſhould not take part with the</hi> Flemings <hi>againſt</hi> France, <hi>That the Kings of</hi> England <hi>ſhould be ever quit of their Homage for Territories holden in</hi> France; <hi>and That in

                  </p>
                  <p>And now Fortune ſeemed to turn againſt King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that had hitherto ever been Favourable to him, for <hi>Peter</hi> the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being driven out of his Kingdom by <hi>Henry</hi> his Baſtard Brother, came to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (who then lived at <hi>Burdeaux</hi>) with his Family, Imploring his Aſſiſtance to Reſtore him, which he did, Overthrowing a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Army that had joyned the Revolted <hi>Caſtilians</hi> with great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet he was no ſooner retired, ere King <hi>Peter</hi> was again driven out, and being taken in his Flight, was by the Uſurper put to Death; but leaving two Daughters, the Eldeſt Married <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the Younger <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> King <hi>Edwards</hi> Sons, who laid Claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in their Right, yet an unlucky Accident croſſed all, for the Black Prince (to Pay his Souldiers) Leavying a Tax on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects beyond the Seas, they not only refuſed to pay it, but looking on it to be an Innovation and Oppreſſion, they perſwaded <hi>Charles</hi> the new <hi>French</hi> King to break the League his Father had made, and generally Revolting delivered up moſt of the Cities, Towns and Caſtles into his hands; and he growing Proud of his Succeſs, ſent a huge Navy into the Narrow Seas, which was defeated and beaten home
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61951:268"/> by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and hereupon the King ſent the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with an Army to <hi>Callais,</hi> from whence he Marched to joyn the Prince at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> beating the <hi>French</hi> Kings Army by the way, and forced his Paſſage; and ſoon after another Army was ſent to St. <hi>Omers</hi> under the Leading of Sr. <hi>Robert Knowls,</hi> which took the ſtrong Towns of <hi>Vanes</hi> and <hi>Ruily,</hi> but there grow-a difference between him and the Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King took the advantage of it, and fell on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army near <hi>Paris,</hi> ſlaying 1000, and putting the reſt to flight; and immediatly ſent an Army into <hi>Cuyan,</hi> where the Prince being weakly aſſiſted, moſt of the Towns were Loſt. To Remedy this evil, the King called a Parliament, wherein the Temporality granted him a large Subſidy, but the Clergy complaining of Poverty, gave him only fair words and promiſes of future Aid, which made him (in his Anger) turn them out of all Offices and Places of Truſt in Temporal matters. And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy going to Relieve <hi>Rochel</hi> under the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> was worſted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Uſurping King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who kept the Narrow Seas for the <hi>French</hi> King, the Earl was Taken and divers others; whereupon <hi>Rochel</hi> and many ſtrong Towns Yielded. This made <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Britanie,</hi> fear the <hi>French</hi> Greatneſs, and offer King <hi>Edward</hi> his Aſſiſtance; ſo that another Army was ſent under the Leading of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which greatly Endamaged the <hi>French,</hi> but coming to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> he found the Prince his Brother exceeding Sick, who reſigning the Government of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Territories to his Conduct, came for <hi>England;</hi> and tho' Treaties were ſet on foot by the Mediation of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Eleventh, yet ſuch were the inſolent demands of the <hi>French,</hi> that they came to nothing. Whereupon the King called a Parliament, who refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61951:268"/> to Grant him any Aid, unleſs the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> and other evil Counſellors were Removed; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, they Liberally ſupplied his wants. But the Black Prince Dying the 8th of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1376, in the 40th Year of his Age, and Buried at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the King in his Old Age being over perſwaded, Reſtored thoſe Officers that had been turned out, to the high diſcontent of his People; and having Created <hi>Richard</hi> (Son to the Black Prince) Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and committed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Kingdom in his Minority to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter:</hi> He Dyed on the 12th of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1377, in the 51ſt Year of his Reign, and about the 65th of his Age, and lies Buried at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> being the One and Thirtieth Sole Monarch of <hi>England.</hi>

However the Money ſet out an indifferent good Fleet; and an Army were ſent into <hi>France</hi> under Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the Kings Unkles, who waſting all in his way, joyned with the Duke of <hi>Britanie,</hi> and much anoyed the <hi>French,</hi> Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering many Towns and Caſtles; but whilſt this was doing abroad, a dangerous Miſchief befell at home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Wall,</hi> a Factious Prieſt, by his going from place to place and Preaching to the inferiour ſort of People, <hi>That they were Free by the Law of Nature; and that Laws were made by Crafty People to keep them Poor and Low, ſo to Enſlave them; and that by their Pedigree, derived from</hi> Adam, <hi>the good things of the Earth ſhould be equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt them; and not ſome grow Fat and Rich, whilſt others Pine and Starve: And moreover, no Taxes were due on any pretence, but People Free Born in their Liberality ought to be left Free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This and ſuch like Cant being ſutable to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and wiſhes, mainly wrought with them to become Levellers, ſo that theſe pernicious Inſinuations ſpread ſoon into moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> before the Magiſtrates were aware to ſuppreſs it; and to bring about what was wiſhed by ſome cunning Knaves, to Inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61951:272"/> in the Spoil of others, they raiſed Tumults, and poſſeſs'd the Country People with a belief, That the City of <hi>London</hi> was at their devotion, and only waited till they came to take poſſeſſion of it; whereupon they flowed thither like an outragious Torrent, from <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Suſſex, Bedfordſhire,</hi> and other places, ſtiling themſelves <hi>The Kings Men, and the Servants of the Weale Publick;</hi> choſing as their chief Captain one <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> by profeſſion a <hi>Taylor;</hi> and as his ſubordinate Officers, <hi>Jack Straw, Jack Shepherd,</hi> and ſome others; and to this Rout, the Incendary of a lewd Prieſt, <hi>John Wall,</hi> Chaplain; and being Encamped in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> they ſent to the King to come and Treat with them; but he was diſſwaded by his Nobles: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thoſe in <hi>Eſſex</hi> croſſed the <hi>Thames,</hi> and joyning the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Rebels, came to <hi>Southwark,</hi> which they Plundered, and finding <hi>London-Bridge</hi> Fortified againſt them, intended to have Burnt the Suburbs on the South ſide, and have Murthered ſuch as they had notice were not pleaſed with their Proceedings: But the Citizens, to prevent ſo great a Miſchief, let down the Draw-Bridge, and admitted them into the City, Feaſting and Carreſſing them, rather out of fear than good-will; however they Burnt the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>'s Houſe at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Murthered all his Servants they found in it. They ranſacked the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> and <hi>Law Offices,</hi> Burning all the Law Books and Records that came to their hands, Plundering the Churches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes; and <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> having ſeized <hi>Richard Lyon</hi> his Maſter, with whom he had been Apprentice, cauſed his Head to be Cut off, and carry'd before him on a Lance, becauſe in his Service he had ſometimes Beat him for his Rogueries: They Plundered likewiſe the Houſes of all Strangers: They likewiſe forced into the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the King Lay, Plundered his Mothers
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61951:273"/> Lodgings, and broke her Head, becauſe ſhe reproved them for their Inſolency. They Murthered <hi>Simon Tybald</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> becauſe he had ſome time before Impriſoned <hi>Wall</hi> for his Seditious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and after ſeveral meetings, the King finding he could do no good with them, their Behaviour being ſo Audacious, and their Demands ſo Inſolent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, he laboured to make the Citizens his Frinds, and reſolved to repel them by force.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon a Conference being appointed in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> the King beforehand thinking to bring them to better Terms without Extremity, if poſſible, ſent them ſeveral of his Enſigns and their Pardons, as a token that he owned them for his good Subjects, and freely forgave them for what had happened; and then meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as appointed he perſwaded them to deſiſt from all Violence, aſſuring them that upon tryal they ſhould find him to be their Good Lord and Gracious King. But <hi>Tyler</hi> with a frowning countenance, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent behaviour, and rough ſpeech, refuſed to accept the Kings Grace and Favour, proudly telling him, That all thoſe Troops, and many more Thouſands, were at his diſpoſe, to Execute whatſoever he would command: Then he commanded Sr. <hi>John Newton</hi> one of the Kings Attendants, who bore the Sword, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Dagger; which by the Kings command he did: Then he Inſolently proceeded to demand the Sword; but he ſtoutly Anſwered, <hi>It was the Kings Sword, and ſhould not be given to a Knave;</hi> which ſo incenſed <hi>Tyler,</hi> That he Swore he ſhould loſe his Head before himſelf would Eat or Drink, commanding the King to deliver him up to Execution; which Inſolent Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Sr. <hi>William Wallworth,</hi> Lord Mayor, not able to endure, Stabbed him with his Dagger, ſo that he fell down Dead; and then haſting to raiſe the City Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61951:273"/> the Rebells after ſome time were ſo amazed, that they ſcattered, and every one fled for his ſafety; and it was not many days before moſt of the Ringleaders were, by their Companions (a thing that ſeldom fails in ſuch tumultuous Rebellions) delivered into the hands of Juſtice, the better to obtain their own Pardons, which in the height of their Pride, they had ſcornfully thrown up, and the King at this laſt Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Faces had Cancelled them; ſo that about 1500 or more of the principal Agents were Convicted, and Executed in divers Places, which put an end to theſe Popular Diſorders; and for this Exploit of the Lord Mayor, the Dagger was added to the City Arms.</p>
                  <p>Things thus Quieted, and the Peoples Fears over, The King ſued for the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> (Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, and Siſter to <hi>Winceſlaus,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi>) in Marriage; which was Accorded, and the Lady (who was exceeding Virtuous and Beautiful) was received with great Joy by the King and People; and <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1385, he Summoned a Parliament at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> in which he Created his Unkle <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> his Couſin <hi>Henry,</hi> Eldeſt Son to the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby; Edward</hi> Son to <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland;</hi> Sir <hi>John Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Mowbray</hi> Earl of <hi>Notingham,</hi> Declaring <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> Son to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Mortimer</hi> and <hi>Philippa</hi> his Wife, Daughter and Heires to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Third Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, Heir apparent to the Crown; but he was Slain by the Rebells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the Kings Death.</p>
                  <p>And now the King fell into the diſlike of his People, by hearkening to evil Counſellours, eſpecially one <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael De La Pool,</hi> whom he had made Chancellour, and created Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Robert Vere</hi> whome he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

But in Anſwer to this, he required that a ſelect Aſſembly of Fifty of their Members ſhould attend him. This was refuſed, and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were only deputed; who plainly told the King of the Grievances of his People, and that by his Abſence from Parliament he obſcured the light of Juſtice, and hindered the Negotiation of the Commonweal: And if he further declined it, they muſt break up and depart to their homes. They alſo craved, with humble ſubmſſion, as they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to be informed by whom his Majeſties Treaſure, belonging to the Commonweal, was prodigally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and how it came to paſs that his large Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues could not ſuffice to maintain his Eſtate and charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing he had no Wars.</p>

                  <p>This Meſſage, and their Demands, ſo angered the King, That he Swore had he fore-known the ſawcy bouldneſs of his Subjects, whom as he ſuppoſed, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to riſe in Arms againſt him, he would more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have ſubmitted himſelf to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and have relyed on him for Protection, than thus to be baffled and made ſervil to thoſe whom his Soveraignty ought to command. But the two Lords in all humble Duty ſhewed him, that his People ſtood well affected towards him, and that the <hi>French</hi> had been and were inveterate Enemies to the King of <hi>England:</hi> With this and ſuch-like ſubmiſſive Diſcourſe, he was ſome what pacified, and promiſed to come to his Parliament in three days, and failed not to do it; where by Proof and Accuſation of the Lords, <hi>Michael De La Pool,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>England,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> was Convicted of Purloyning the Kings Treaſure, and purchaſing Eſtates with it, to his own behoof; and giving evil Counſel to the great damage of the Kings Subjects, and other things, ſo that his Lands were Sequeſtered to the King's uſe, his Perſon Fined 20000 Marks, committed cloſe Priſoner, and deprived of his Chancellourſhip and other Offices.

                  <p>This Conceſſion much pleaſed the Lords, ſo that they disbanded their Forces, and returned the King their humble thanks: But it was not long before they were ſenſible a Snare was laid for them, for the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> was privately Levying 5000 Men, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly

                  <p>After the flight of the Duke, the Lords Executed ſome of the chief Ringleaders, and ſuffered the reſt to depart to their Houſes, and ſo paſſed with their Army to <hi>London,</hi> where they were Joyfully received by the Citizens. The King, who kept his Court at the <hi>Tower,</hi> well perceived how much they had gained the Hearts of the greater Part of the People, and therefore for his own ſafety he deſired a Conference with them, in which it was Agreed a Parliament ſhould be ſpeedily called, to Redreſs Grievances; and accordingly a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was Aſſembled, in which the evil Counſellours and corrupt Judges were Sommoned to appear and Anſwer to the Articles Exhibited againſt them; but upon their default, they were Attainted of High Treaſon againſt the King and Common-weal, and for this <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Bambre</hi> loſt their Heads; the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Triſilian</hi> was Hanged at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and the reſt of theſe Judges had ſuffered in like manner, had not the Queens inceſſant ſupplications prevailed to change their Dooms into Baniſhment; and in this Parliament the ſtate of Affairs was ſettled to the high contentment of the People. And tho' the next Year the <hi>Scots</hi> began to buſtle, yet at the Mediation of the <hi>French King</hi> a Truce was made
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61951:277"/> between the three Kingdoms, and King <hi>Richard</hi> by this means in Peace and Tranquility, aſſiſted the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to raiſe an Army, when Leaguing with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he Warred on the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which he claimed in Right of his Wife; and ſo prevailed, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was compelled to ſue for a Peace; which was granted on that Kings Marrying <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Dukes Eldeſt Daughter, Loading him Eight Waggons with Gold, and allowing him and his Dutcheſs during their Lives 10000 Mark a Year. And after having Married <hi>Ann,</hi> his Younger Daughter, to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England,</hi> Laden with Riches and Honour. And now all Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this Kingdom, was Abrogated by Parliament; and ſoon after, the Vertuous Lady Queen <hi>Ann</hi> Dyed; whoſe Death ſo exceedingly grieved the King, that for ſome Weeks he would not be comforted, cauſing the ſtately Houſe at <hi>Sheen</hi> in which ſhe Dyed, to be utterly Razed; Curſing any that ſhould afterward Build it; yet this Sorrow waſting by time, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Alliance he Sailed to <hi>France,</hi> and took the Lady <hi>Iſabel, Charles</hi> the Sixth's Daughter, to Wife, and brought her to <hi>England</hi> with her Nurſe, and a great Train of Ladies; and not exceeding Seven or Eight Years, ſhe was called <hi>The Baby Queen;</hi> the King having contracted not to Bed her till ſhe ſhould be Fourteen Years of Age, and a 30 Years Peace was concluded; whereupon the King gave up to the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> the ſtrong Town and Caſtle of <hi>Breſt;</hi> which much offended the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Unkle, who plainly told him, he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured himſelf and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation by tamely parting with ſuch an important Place, which had not been gained but at the expence of much Blood and

But the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſtood too high in the Peoples Favour to be reached this way; therefore he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſeized at his own Houſe, hurried to <hi>Callice,</hi> and there by the command of <hi>Thomas Moubray</hi> then Earl of <hi>Notingham,</hi> and for this wicked exploit created Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Valiant, Prudent, Virtuous, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Duke, was Smothered to Death; tho' in the manner of it Authors diſagree; ſome will have it by preſſing and keeping him long between Feather-Beds; others, that he was thrown into, and headed up in a Butt of Malmſey: However here he was wickedly made away, and never ſeen afterward, to the great grief of all but the King and his Favourites who hugged themſelves with joy, to think they had removed out of their way the great Obſtacle that hindered their Advances to Arbitrary Power.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Moubray</hi> proceeded to Accuſe <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hartford,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> of Speaking Treaſonable and Scandalous Words of the King; whereupon <hi>Hartford</hi> Challenged his Accuſer to

But theſe Proceedings bred much Miſchief: For the King having loſt moſt of his old, and getting a new ſet of Counſelors, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>John Buſhe,</hi> Sir <hi>James Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Green;</hi> they adviſed him to many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Advice of his grave Council and much troubled the People; and now the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebelling, the King to Raiſe an Army Farmed the Kingdom, and all his Revenues belonging thereunto, for certain Years, and Sailed for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Hartford</hi> who wanted no Intelligence how matters went in <hi>England,</hi> looked on the Peoples Ferment, and the Kings Abſence, to give him a very favourable advantage to ſhake off his Chains; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as privately as he might, he came to <hi>England,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Baniſhed Arch Biſhop and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſty Friends, declaring to the People he only came to take quiet Poſſeſſion of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which by the Death of his Father was his Undoubted
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61951:278"/> Right; ſo that Trouſands flocked to him. And fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how the People were bent to favour his cauſe, he Raiſed a conſiderable Army, and ſeized the before named Counſellours, whom they Beheaded.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> hearing of theſe Stirs, ſetled Affaires there as well as he could, and haſted over with a ſmall Army; but before he could paſs <hi>Wales,</hi> moſt of them had Deſerted him; and then being aſcertained that his Counſellours in whom he had repoſed much truſt to Levy Forces for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were taken off, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſafety to be gained by force, he came to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> of his own accord; and publickly owned his Inſufficiency and Weakneſs to Govern well; praiſing the Duke's rare and ſingular Virtues, his abſolute worthineſs to be a King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> profering to make him an abſolute Surrender of his Kingdom, if he would accept of it.</p>
                  <p>The Politick Duke, who well knew this proceeded not cordially from him, but from the effects of fear and conſtraint, however refuſed it; for tho' he much affected the wearing of a Crown, yet he thought it more adviſable to receive it at this time from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, and Commonalty; and hereupon he cauſed the King with a very reſpective and honourable Attendance, to be conveyed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being called in his Name, Twenty Four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were Exhibited againſt him for Miſmanagement and ill Conduct in Government, and many henious Crimes; which in his Reſtraint he ſeemed to confeſs and own, and by an Inſtrument under his Hand and Seal, he Reſigned his Crown and Kingdom to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullenbrook</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> which being publickly and generally Ratified and Approved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, <hi>Henry</hi> ſtood up and made this Challenge to the <hi>Crown, viz.</hi>

                  <head>The Reign of <hi>HENRY</hi> the Fourth (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullenbrook.</hi>)</head>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Henry</hi> was <hi>Crowned</hi> by the conſent of the Eſtates, in the life time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and created <hi>Henry</hi> his Eldeſt Son Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> Then he called a Parliament in his own Name, in which the Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> for ſpeaking in the behalf of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and moving a commiſeration of his wrongs, was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cloſe Priſoner to the Abby of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> was entailed on <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs forever.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament no ſooner ended, but many Lords Conſpired the Death of the King, entering into <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> to do it at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſollemn Sports for his Entertainment, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (as they Flatteringly pretended) of his happy Acceſſion to the <hi>Crown;</hi> but really with an intent to reſtore King <hi>Richard:</hi> And accordingly they met Armed, all but <hi>Edward Plantagenet,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumarle,</hi> Son to <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Kings Unkle; who as he ſat at Dinner with his Father, had by
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61951:282"/> chance the Label of the Inſtrument of Combination hanging out at his Boſom, of which the old Duke taking hold, drew forth the whole Writing, and Reading the Contents of the Conſpiracy, prepared for <hi>Windſor,</hi> to give the King an account of it; which the young Duke perceiving, haſtily took Horſe, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript him, himſelf revealing all the Intrigue, for which he had his Pardon.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Diſcovery, the King put off his Journey to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and haſtened to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the <hi>City</hi> to his Intereſt, and raiſing an Army; of which the Lords at <hi>Oxford</hi> had no ſooner notice, but they encreaſed their Forces, cauſing one <hi>Magdalen,</hi> much in likeneſs, to Perſonate King <hi>Richard,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced their Standard to meet the King; but finding they were much inferiour to him in Number, their courage failed; which ſo diſheartened the Souldiers, that they diſperſed and left their Leaders to ſhift for themſelves; ſo that moſt of them were Taken and Executed in divers places; others fled the Kingdom, and reſerved themſelves to broach new Broils; and this haſtened King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Murther, in the manner as has been ſaid: For King <hi>Henry</hi> complaining that ſo long as he Lived he ſhould never be at reſt, and demanding if none loved him ſo well as to rid him of that Torment, <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton,</hi> to curry favour with him, poſted away, and with other Ruffians villainouſly performed it; at which the <hi>French King</hi> was mightily diſpleaſed, purpoſing to ſend his Letters of Defiance to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and Invade his Kingdom; but upon ſecond thoughts, tho' he had raiſed a potent Army, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it, and proceeded no further in the buſineſs. Yet ſoon after he Levied another Army to Invade <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and <hi>Guyan;</hi> but was ſo ſtoutly withſtood by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Forces, That he retired and Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61951:283"/> them. But the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doubting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his ill-got Title, laboured to make Peace with him, the better to ſtrengthen himſelf, offering a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, and the Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Widow to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of <hi>France;</hi> but that <hi>King</hi> conſidering how unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Marriages had been between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> refuſed it; whereupon ſhe was ſent over in great State, and Married to her Couſin <hi>Charles,</hi> Eldeſt Son of <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> her Unkle.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, <hi>Owen Glendour,</hi> with his <hi>Welſh,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled; Overthrowing the <hi>King</hi>'s Army, and taking the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Edmund Mortimer,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> Couſin, Priſoners; uſing them exceeding hardly, the ſooner to oblige the <hi>King</hi> to Ranſom them; but he neglected it, becauſe <hi>Mortimer</hi> was nearer Allied to the <hi>Crown</hi> by Right of Deſcent, than himſelf; yet tho' he might have had his Liberty, if he would have joyned with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles, that were fled thither, he rather choſe to endure Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than to comply with them: Whereupon they ſolicited the <hi>Scots,</hi> who Invaded the Northern parts of the Kingdom, doing much Miſchief; but the <hi>King</hi> ſoon requited it, by entering <hi>Scotland,</hi> and laying all waſte before him: However he no ſooner returned, but the <hi>Scots</hi> re-entered <hi>England</hi> with 20000 Men, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many Barbarous Cruelties; but being Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>Henry</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> Son to <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> 10000 of them were Slain, and 500 taken Priſoners; and of note <hi>Mordacke</hi> Earl of <hi>Fiffe, Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Douglas, Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus.</hi> The following Year the <hi>French</hi> ſent 12 Ships with 1200 Nobles, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and others, to aſſiſt the <hi>Welſh,</hi> but moſt of them were Shipwrack'd on the Point of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61951:283"/> reſt with much difficulty returned to <hi>France;</hi> yet ſoon after he Landed 12000 Men in <hi>Wales</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Glendour</hi> and his Rebellious Companions, who joyned them with 10000. But upon the Kings approach with an Army, the <hi>Welſh</hi> fled into the Woods and Mountains, leaving the <hi>French</hi> to ſhift for themſelves; which made them haſten to their Ships, and return to <hi>France,</hi> without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing Memorable; which made the <hi>French King</hi> become a Jeſt to the <hi>Engliſh, viz. That he was often Big, but never Brought-forth.</hi> Notwithſtanding King <hi>Henry,</hi> to Strengthen his Intereſt Abroad, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Jane,</hi> Widow to <hi>John</hi> the deceaſed Duke of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> and gave <hi>Blanch</hi> his Eldeſt Daughter, to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Son and Heir Apparent to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and ſome time after <hi>Philippa</hi> his Youngeſt Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Third Year of his Reign he required <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Worceſter, Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and <hi>Piercy Hotſpur</hi> his Son, to deliver up the <hi>Scots</hi> Priſoners taken in the late Battel on the Northern Borders; but was Anſwered, <hi>Thoſe Priſoners were theirs by Right of War, and they would not part with them;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him at the ſame time to Ranſom his Couſin <hi>Mortimer;</hi> but this he refuſed, alledging, That he had voluntarily made himſelf a Priſoner to give <hi>Glendour</hi> and other his Accomplices a colourable pretence for Rebellion, ſeeing he was ſo near Allied to the Crown; and therefore his own Safety, and his good Diſcretion, gave him Advice not to hearken to their Motion, but to puniſh his offence.</p>
                  <p>This much diſpleaſed the <hi>Piercies,</hi> and deſigning to Levy War againſt the King, they Ranſomed <hi>Mortimer</hi> at their own charge, ſecretly entering into a League and Friendſhip with <hi>Glendour,</hi> they promiſed him great matters when King <hi>Henry</hi> by their United Strength
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61951:284"/> ſhould be Depoſed; then they Engaged the <hi>Scots</hi> Priſoners to take part with them; alſo the Earl of <hi>Stafford, Richard Scroop</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and many others; and as they had done againſt <hi>Richard,</hi> ſo they framed and publiſhed Articles againſt him, as to his Miſdemeanours in Government, falſe claim to the Crown, charging him with the Murther of King <hi>Richard</hi> his Lawful and Rightful Soveraign; alſo his refuſing to Ranſom his Couſin <hi>Mortimer</hi> who was taken Fighting in his Cauſe, but rather wiſhed he might die in a loathſome Priſon, becauſe the Crown of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, as being Son and Heir to <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter and Heireſs to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Father to <hi>Henry,</hi> whom they ſtiled a Uſurper.</p>
                  <p>This made many joyn with them, ſo that their Army became very Formidable to the King: And to bind the <hi>Welſh</hi> more firmly to them, <hi>Edward Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> Married <hi>Glendour</hi>'s Daughter; by which means in a little time they flattered themſelves they ſhould have a King of <hi>England</hi> of the Antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Blood: And indeed a very great danger about this time threatened the King, for a <hi>Calthrop,</hi> or <hi>Engin</hi> with three very ſharp Teeth or Spikes, was placed in his Bed, which had certainly procured his Death, had he ſuddainly lain down upon it, but it was timely Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; yet the Party who placed it could not be made known, and divers <hi>Gray Fryers</hi> ſcattering defamatory Libels againſt the King, ſeveral of them were taken and Hanged.</p>
                  <p>The King finding his greateſt advantage now lay in Expedition, ſuddainly raiſed an Army, and by long Marches prevented the Earls joyning with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> ſo that both Armies meeting near <hi>Shrewsbury, Piercy Hotſpur,</hi> a Perſon of undaunted Courage, no
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61951:284"/> ſooner ſaw the Royal Standard, but he reſolved to throw his Fortune on the hazard of a Battel; ſo the Charge being Sounded, the <hi>Scots</hi> gave the firſt onſet, and Fought deſperately, but were over-born, and a great part of them Slain; yet notwithſtanding the Lords renewed the Battel with great fury and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, perſwading themſelves of good ſucceſs, until the King and the Prince his Son (determining by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Death to leave their Bodies in the Field, rather than fall into the hands of their Enemies, or betake them to ſhameful flight, and leave their Men a Sacrifice behind them) redoubling their Strength and Valour, ſet ſuch Examples to the reſt, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Battel was reſtored, and <hi>Piercy Hotſpur</hi> with many of chief Command being Slain, the Lords Army fell into rout and confuſion; ſo that in the Field and Purſuit 6000 were ſlain, the Earls of <hi>Worceſter, Douglas,</hi> and many others were taken Priſoners, and a famous Victory was obtained; and it is ſaid the King ſlew in this Battel 36 with his own hands; but becauſe the Earl <hi>Douglas</hi> in ſingle Combate had fought with him, and approved himſelf a valiant Man, he had his Liberty granted without Ranſom; but the reſt of the Priſoners had not that good luck; for the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſeveral of the chief, were Beheaded; many of a lower degree Hanged and Quartered, and their Heads placed on <hi>London Bridge.</hi> In this Battel the King loſt not above 600 Men.</p>
                  <p>To follow this lucky Succeſs, the Prince was ſent into <hi>Wales,</hi> with part of the Army; where he found <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> forſaken by moſt of his Companions, and with the reſt for his ſafety he retired into a vaſt Wood, which being encompaſſed and narrowly watched, he was there, with many others, Famiſhed to Death; and ſuch as were taken by hunting and beating that Wood,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61951:285"/> ſuffered by Execution. And hereupon the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the King; and in the mean while the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> came and ſubmitted himſelf to the Kings Mercy; and tho' he was excuſed, it was with no hearty goodwill, but rather to prevent the Caſtle of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and other ſtrong Places on the Frontiers, from falling into the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as being held by ſuch Officers as the Earl had appointed under him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Troubles were no ſooner over, but <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> ſent the King (in a Bravado) a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to meet him and a Hundred <hi>French</hi> with a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to Combate it for Honours ſake in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different place; whereto the King returned Anſwer, <hi>That his former Actions in Warlike undertakings, could clearly acquit him from the imputation of Cowardize; and that Kings ought not to be ſo careleſs of their Peoples well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſafety, as to meet every Madman who had the vanity to ſend them a Challenge: But that he would be at all times ready to Repel any Violence or Injury which he ſhould dare raſhly or unadviſedly to Attempt againſt him or his People.</hi> This exceedingly nettled <hi>Mounſieur;</hi> ſo that in an angry mood, deſigning Revenge, he Beſieged the Town of <hi>Vergie</hi> in <hi>Guyan;</hi> but having waſted his Army in almoſt a four Months Siege, he was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe it, and retire with diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>After this the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, raiſed an Army to reduce <hi>Callis;</hi> but upon King <hi>Henry</hi>'s preparations to paſs the Seas with an Army, he was Remanded by the <hi>French King;</hi> which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on as the Duke of <hi>Orleances</hi> doings, to hinder him from gathering expected Lawrels, a mortal hatred ſprung up between them, and ſeveral Battels were Fought; King <hi>Henry</hi> firſt aſſiſting <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and then <hi>Orleance;</hi> and gained much Money by their Contention, whilſt they weakened each other, and the whole Eſtate
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61951:285"/> of <hi>France;</hi> whilſt they drew in Parties to ſide with them. In the mean while the Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> laying Siege to a Town in <hi>Gaſcony</hi> with 4000 Men at Arms, was beaten off by Sir <hi>John Blunt,</hi> with 300 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 12 Noblemen, and 120 Gentlemen, taken Priſoners and carried into the Town in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>And now tho' the King had Pardoned the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> yet he reſenting ſome Indignities put on him, grew reſtleſs for Revenge, and therefore Aſſociating with <hi>Richard Scroop</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>York, Thomas Moubray,</hi> Earl Marſhal, The Lords <hi>Haſtings, Faulconbridge, Bardolf,</hi> and divers others, Forces were reſolved to be raiſed, and another hazard of the Field to be Enterpriſed: But the Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> whom they would have drawn to their Party, revealing their Deſign to the King, he ſecretly Marched with an Army into the North, and ſurpriſing <hi>Moubray, Scroop,</hi> and ſome others, cauſed their Heads to be ſtricken off; but <hi>Northumberland, Bardolf, &amp;c.</hi> Eſcaped to <hi>France,</hi> from whence they afterward came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where that King promiſed to Aid them; but to prevent the threatening Danger, the King raiſed a potent Army, and ſent it under the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he Retook <hi>Berwick, Alnwick,</hi> and other ſtrong places, that the Earl had delivered to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and Burnt many Towns in the heart of that Kingdom; whereupon the <hi>Scots,</hi> finding themſelves unable to make Reſiſtance, craved a Truce, which was Granted for twelve Months; and thereupon the Prince retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home with his Spoils.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt this was doing, the <hi>French</hi> (to favour the Deſign) ſet out ſeveral Armed Ships, to Alarum the Coaſt Towns of <hi>England,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Caſtile,</hi> with three other Lords, 20 Knights, and a great many Soldiers, Landing at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> were Encountered by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61951:286"/> the Country People, who Slew <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and moſt of his Soldiers; and taking the reſt Priſoners, brought them to the King, who very well rewarded the Ruſticks for their Care and Vigilancy, and put the Lords and Knights to great Ranſoms; and the King going to ſee them on Board at their departure, in his return from the <hi>Downs</hi> very narrowly ſcaped being taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privatier's ſuppoſedly lying purpoſely in wait for him; whereupon the Lord <hi>Commois</hi> who attended him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Norman</hi> Nobleman, was ſuſpected of Treachery, but upon his Tryal acquitted, and received into Favour.</p>
                  <p>The Truce with <hi>Scotland</hi> Expired, <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Bardolf</hi> Animated the <hi>Scots</hi> to Invade <hi>England,</hi> which they did, doing much miſchief in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Northern parts: Whereupon the <hi>King</hi> Levied an Army and Traveled by long Marches to Encounter them, but before his Arrival, they were Fought-with and Overthrown by Sir <hi>Thomas Rookby,</hi> High Sherif of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> who ſlew the Earl and ſent his Head as a Preſent to the <hi>King</hi> that was very acceptably received, and the Lord <hi>Bardolf</hi> being Wounded, fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there Dyed of his Wounds.</p>
                  <p>After this the <hi>King</hi> Aſſembling a Parliament, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated therein his three Younger Sons, <hi>viz. Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Humphry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter;</hi> and many Laws were therein Enacted profitable to the Common-weal; and from this Day till his Death, the <hi>King</hi> Enjoyed a Life free from Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but found ſuch Inward perplexities of Mind, for having Conſented to, or Inſtigated, the Murther of King <hi>Richard</hi> his firſt Couſin, for the lucre of his <hi>Crown,</hi> that to make ſome Attonement, and quiet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he Levied an Army, reſolving (as he had Vowed) to make War againſt the Infidels that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Chriſtians in the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> which the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61951:286"/> Popes of thoſe times declared was a full Atonement, or ſufficient Expiation for any Crime, how Notorious ſo ever; but whilſt things were getting ready, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Appoplexy; and finding Death approaching, cauſed his <hi>Crown</hi> to be placed on his Pillow, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deliver it to the Prince when he was near De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting; but he, impatient of delay, ſuppoſing him (when fallen into a Drowſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs) to be Dead, removed it thence; whereupon the <hi>King</hi> raiſed himſelf, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, demanded <hi>Who had taken it?</hi> And the Prince Replying, <hi>It was he:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> fell back, and fetching a deep Sigh, ſaid, <hi>My Son, what Right I had to this Crown, and how I have Enioyed it, God knows, and the World hath ſeen;</hi> and thereupon he fetched a deep Groan; but the Prince not minding that, ſaid, <hi>Comfort your ſelf in God, Father; The Crown you have, and if you Dye, it is mine, and I will keep it with my Sword as you have done;</hi> and within a few Hours the <hi>King</hi> dyed, in the 46th Year of his Age, when he had Reigned 13 Years, 5 Months, and 19 Days; and was Buried at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Anno</hi> 1412.</p>
                  <p>In this Kings Reign two Blazing Stars appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breaking out of the <hi>Piercy</hi>'s Rebellion, and many Drops of Blood fell on Peoples Garments in the Northern Parts, as from the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1407 a great Plague happened, that deſtroyed in <hi>London</hi> 30000 Perſons, and multitudes elſe where; and the Year after, a violent Froſt held 15 Weeks.</p>
                  <p>And by the wicked procurement of <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, William Sawtree, William Swinderby,</hi> and <hi>William Thorp,</hi> worthy Divines, ſuffered Martyrdome for oppoſing the Romiſh Superſtitions and Idolatry, Preaching the Goſpel, and much adhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Wickliffe</hi>'s Doctrine.</p>

                  <head>The Reign of <hi>HENRY</hi> the Fifth (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>)</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Henry,</hi> the greater part of his Fathers Reign, was much lead away by evil Company, and was not free from committing in his Frolicks Robberies on the Highway, eſpecially on his own Receivers; and one of his Gang being taken, and about to be Sentenced in the Court of <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> he ruſhed in and laboured to pull off his Irons, in order to ſet him at Liberty; but the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> commanded him to deſiſt; whereupon in a rage, he went up to the Bench, and Struck him on the Face; for which (after he had given him ſome mild Reproofs, as that the Bench he ſat on was the Kings, and that himſelf in that place repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Perſon, and what Injury was done to him, was done to the King; and if he ſhewed ſuch evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, none would Obey him when he came to Reign) he ſent him to the <hi>Kings Bench Priſon,</hi> till the Kings pleaſure ſhould be known in the matter. The King no ſooner heard of it, but he commended the Judge for his Courage and Impartiality, wiſhing all his Miniſters were like him; and though the Prince was Enlarged, yet for this he was put from his Preſidentſhip in the Council, and his Younger Brother <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> placed therein, to his great Grief.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and other Irregular Paſſages of his paſt Years, (when he was Crowned by <hi>Arundel</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) he wiſely conſidered; and to repair what had been amiſs, ſtrictly forbid the Leud Companions of his Youth to enter his Court, or any
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:61951:290"/> where come near his Perſon, till he had ſome cauſe to believe they had reformed and mended their Manners; yet ordered ſome of them, who had run out their Eſtates in purſuing his wild Extravagancies, ſmall Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Subſiſt on, till they could better provide for themſelves, Electing none for his Councel, nor into Places of Juſtice, or publick Government, but ſuch as were of known Integrity, Wiſe, Sober, and not to be Biaſed through fear or favour; greatly labouring to Reform the Abuſes of the Clergy; and for the better ſecurity of the <hi>Marches,</hi> he cauſed the Caſtles and Towns thereabouts to be Repaired and Strongly Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned, by which means he Awed the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Welſh,</hi> and kept his People free from their former fears and apprehenſions of danger.</p>
                  <p>And the better to ſhew he had no hand in, nor was conſenting to the Death of King <hi>Richard,</hi> he cauſed his Body to be brought from <hi>Langley</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in much Funeral Pomp, and to be Interred by Queen <hi>Ann</hi> his beloved Wife.</p>
                  <p>In the Second Year of his Reign he Aſſembled a Parliament at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> wherein he was Importunately Addreſſed to ſupreſs Religious Houſes, where they were ill mannaged, and in ſtead of promoting Godly Lives, had been made the Nurſeries of Gluttony, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride, and all Uncleanneſs; conſidering they would yield into his Coffers an <hi>Annual</hi> Rent of 20000<hi>l</hi>; which might be better Employed for the Support of the Crown, and Honour and Safety of the Kingdom, in maintaining 15 <hi>Earls,</hi> 1500 <hi>Knights,</hi> and more than 6000 <hi>Men at Arms;</hi> beſides a great Number of <hi>Almes Houſes</hi> for the ſupport and relief of the <hi>Poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This much ſtartled the <hi>Abbots, Priors, Fryers, Monks, Nuns, &amp;c.</hi> as fearing to be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Hived,</hi> and forced to Labour for their Livings; which they were little able
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:61951:291"/> to do, conſidering they had ſo long been inured to a habit of Idleneſs; and therefore to turn the Stream another way, at their inſtant Entreaties, <hi>Henry Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly</hi> who Succeeded <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> in the Archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> took an opportunity in a very Learned Oration to make the King ſenſible of his Right to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> inciting him to Claim it as his proper Inheritance; and in the Clergies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, for the carrying on the Wars, he offered a large Sum of Money; whereupon the other buſineſs was laid aſide, and nothing now conſiderably debated or ſpoken of, but how the King might Recover <hi>France:</hi> The People every where ſhewing a willingneſs to Embark in the Undertaking: And a Noble Embaſſy was ſent to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, peremptorily to demand the peaceable delivery of the Kingdom, together with the Dutchies of <hi>Aquitain, Normandy, Anjou,</hi> and whatever had formerly appertained to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and if the <hi>French King</hi> without Effuſion of Blood would yield to his demands, he would take the Lady <hi>Catherine,</hi> the Kings Daughter, to Wife, and Endow her with all the Dutchies and Provinces; and be tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in every thing tending to the <hi>French King</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſtate; but upon the Refuſal, he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the gaining it by the Sword, and bring on that Kingdom all the Miſeries that are inſeparable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on a cruel War.</p>
                  <p>The unexpected ſtrangeneſs of this Meſſage, ſo amazed the <hi>French King</hi> and his Nobles, that they could make no ready Anſwer, but promiſed to ſend Ambaſſadors to King <hi>Henry,</hi> who ſhould endeavour to Adjuſt this weighty Affair; yet the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had no ſooner notice of the <hi>King</hi>'s Demands, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his Youth, and holding him unfit to attempt a matter of ſo high a conſequence, in a ſcoffing manner
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61951:291"/> ſent him a Tun of <hi>Racket-Balls</hi> to ſport with in his <hi>Tennis-Court:</hi> This ſo Angered him that <hi>He Vowed</hi> (by Gods aſſiſtance) <hi>ere many Months were over, he would toſs ſo many Iron Balls within the Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>that their ſtrongeſt Rackets ſhould be too weak to turn them.</hi> And hereupon he Levied a puiſſant Army; ſo that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> ſeeing him in earneſt, began to repent of his Raſhneſs, and governing Affairs under his Father, whoſe Imbecility rendered him not very capable of it, he ſent Ambaſſadors to Inform King <hi>Henry,</hi> That if he would deſiſt from his Purpoſe, and Live in Amity with that Nation, and take the Lady <hi>Catharine</hi> his Siſter to Wife, he ſhould then receive with her a large Sum of Money, with ſome ſmall Territories and Poſſeſſions in that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>To this King <hi>Henry</hi> Replied, That unſeſs with the Lady he might have the Dutchies of <hi>Normandy, Anjou, Aquitain,</hi> and all the other Signories, to him and to his Crown juſtly appertaining, he would not wave his Title to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> but attempt by all Hoſtile means to win it, if he might; and with this Anſwer the Ambaſſadors departed much diſſatisfied: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon King <hi>Henry</hi> ſettling his Affairs, appointing his Mother Regent, and joyning to her Council many grave Perſons for the Management of the Government, he Marched his Army to the Sea Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Dauphin</hi> began to play another game; for <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Grey,</hi> three approved Captains, Bribed by him with vaſt Sums, reſolved to Seize the <hi>King,</hi> and carry him into <hi>France;</hi> or if that proved too difficult, to Murther him in his Tent before he took Shipping; but this Treaſon being timely Diſcovered, and made out by Proof, and their own Confeſſions, they were the day after their Tryals Executed in the Camp; and as
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61951:292"/> ſoon as the Wind ſerved in 140 Ships he Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Army to <hi>Normandy;</hi> and in 34 Days Took <hi>Hareflew,</hi> on the River <hi>Seine;</hi> Inriching his Army with the Spoiles, and placing the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> his Unkle, as Captain there, and a Garriſon of 1500 Men. He reſolved, becauſe the Seaſon advanced apace, to March over-Land to <hi>Callis,</hi> and Winter there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> by this time had got a very numerous Army in the Field, and was attended by almoſt all the Nobility and Gentry of the <hi>French Nation,</hi> and having notice of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s March, it was Debated whether he ſhould be ſuffered to paſs to <hi>Callis,</hi> or be Fought with by the way; at laſt in the <hi>French Kings Council</hi> by far the greater Number, it was carried to give him Battel, ſince he had paſſed the River <hi>Soam,</hi> and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Country, his Army conſiſting but of 2000 Horſe, and 13000 Archers and Men at Armes, many of them being Sick, and wanting moſtly Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; whereupon a Herald was ſent to him with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, commanding him to prepare within a few days for the Battel: To this he preſently Anſwered, <hi>That his Army being afflicted with Sickneſs and Wants, he was bending his Courſe to</hi> Callis <hi>to Refreſh his Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not ſeek his Enemy; but if they dared to Interrupt him in his Paſſage, he was of ſufficient Force to Repel all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence which the</hi> French Nation <hi>ſhould oppoſe againſt him;</hi> upon this Anſwer a Proclamation was put out, That all who loved their Country, and were deſirous to fight for Honour, ſhould ſtraight-waies repair to the <hi>French Kings</hi> Standard; ſo that the Army ſoon encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to upward of 60000, moſtly Horſe, conſiſting of the Flower of the <hi>French Nation.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> was not Ignorant of this, nor of their haſty Marches towards him; ſo that pitching his Tents between the Towns of <hi>Balangie</hi> and <hi>Agincourt,</hi> in the County of <hi>St. Paul,</hi>
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:61951:292"/> he reſolved to expect them; which was not long, ſo that in a manner Incompaſſing his little Army with their Multitudes, they were ſo ſure of Victory, that they made great Fires; and held Revels in their Camp, whilſt King <hi>Henry</hi> and his People were in a deep <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> deſiring aſſiſtance of God.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1414, The Armies on both ſides were ſet in Array, each dividing into three Battels; King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Vaunt-Guard was Commanded in chief by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Main-Battel by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Rear-Guard by <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Exeter;</hi> and to prevent any ſuddain breaking in of the French Horſe, he cauſed his Archers and Men at Arms to be invironed with Stakes ſix or ſeven Foot long, headed with ſharp Iron, which faſtened at one end in the Ground, might eaſily upon occaſion be removed; on the Wing, as the French Horſe were to come on, he placed in a Meadow 1500 Archers, having a Ditch before them, that could not eaſily be Leaped; and when Sir <hi>Walter Harpington</hi> Marſhal of the Field, caſt up his Gantlet, the whole Band of Archers were to deliver their flights of Arrows with a great ſhout; all which was ſo exactly obſerved, That the French Horſe of their firſt Battel were no ſooner within the danger of the Ambuſh, but they were gauled by the Archers, and many of their Riders thrown to the Ground and trampled to Death; Then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vant-guard let fly, dimming the Air with their ſhowers of Arrows, working a miſerable Deſtruction to the <hi>French;</hi> ſo that by the unrulineſs of the wounded Horſes, this Battel ſoon fell into diſorder and confuſion, preſſing violently upon one another, breaking in upon the Foot for Retreat, and doing great miſchief; which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> perceiving, ſlung their Bows and with Mawls, Axes, Swords, Gleves, and Bills, made an incredible
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61951:293"/> ſlaughter among them; and having put theſe to the Rout, they run fiercely on the middle Battel of the <hi>French,</hi> who for a while Fought with great Courage and Reſolution; and having done them conſiderable miſchief, they ſeemed Politickly to Faint and Retire, which was to train the Enemy on their ſharp pointed Stakes; and it ſo well ſucceeded, that the French Horſe ruſhing on furiouſly, without ſeeing the danger, were miſerably Goared, ſtopping one another, and making a Barricade for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whilſt they had leaſure to ply them with their flights of Arrows, till in a ſhort time that Battel (as the former) was altogether in Rout and Confuſion; and then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> breaking in as before, the King fought hand to hand with the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> and was ſo violently ſtriken by him, that it broke the ſmall Crown he wore on his Helmet that day; to diſtinguiſh him in the Battel; and he had nearly taken him Priſoner, but the King recovering from the Stund he received from the forcible blow, ſlew two of his Companions, and beat him down; whereat he cried out, <hi>I am your Couſin</hi> Alanſon, <hi>ſpare my Life;</hi> and tho' the King laboured to do it, his Guards were ſo enraged againſt him for endangering the Life of their Soveraign, that they ſlew him as he lay on the Ground.</p>
                  <p>This Battel being utterly Defeated, the Third (which conſiſted almoſt all of Foot) being Charged, and fearing to be Incompaſſed, threw down their Arms, and as many as could fled; but great Numbers who could not, fell on their Knees and begged Quarter, which was granted: But fatally to them, in the cloſe of the Fight, <hi>Robinet</hi> of <hi>Bonvile</hi> with 600 of thoſe Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which had firſt acquitted the Field, entered the Kings Camp, Guarded only by Lacquies and Scullions, and ſlew many of thoſe weak Defendants, who raiſing
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61951:293"/> a doleful cry, the King verily ſuppoſed freſh Forces were come to Engage his weary Soldiers; and there being almoſt as many Priſoners as he had Men of his own, fearing they ſhould Revolt, and do him great miſchief in a renewed Fight, he cauſed it to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed on pain of Death, <hi>That all ordinary Priſoners ſhould immediatly be put to the Sword;</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done to about 8000; but when the King knew the true cauſe of the new uproar, and had ſlain almoſt all thoſe 600 that rifled his Camp, he condemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of too much Cruelty in putting the Priſoners to the Sword, when he had given them Quarter, bewailing it with Tears, and cauſed his Surgeons to lookafter ſuch as yet weltered in their Blood, or there might be any hopes to recover, and ſome were recovered; for in ſo ſuddain an Execution, many received Wounds that were not Mortal.</p>
                  <p>This famous Victory obtained, the King fell on his Knees, and cauſed all the Army to do the like; and with up-lifted Hands ſay, <hi>Lord, Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Name be Glory and Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Battel (which the King ſaid ſhould be called <hi>The Battel of Agincourt</hi> to all Poſterity, becauſe Fought near that Town) were ſlain of the French, <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Delabreth,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France, Jaques</hi> Lord of <hi>Dampire,</hi> High Admiral, <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Alanſon, Anthony</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant, Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Barre;</hi> The Earls of <hi>Marle, Vaudemont, Blawmount, Grand Pree, Ruſſey, Faulconbridg, Foys,</hi> and <hi>Laſtrake,</hi> 25 Lords, 8000 Knights, Eſquires, and Gentlemen, and about 10000 of the meaner ſort.</p>
                  <p>The Priſoners of Note were <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> The Lords <hi>Donuart, Foſſeux, Humiers, Roy, Cawny, Hamcourt, Noell, Bonciqualt,</hi> and ſome others; and on King <hi>Henry</hi>'s part of Note were ſlain <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Worceſter:</hi>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:61951:294"/> Some Hiſtorians will have the latter to be the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and not above 600 others of all Ranks. The King who before the Battel had Vowed to Dye or Conquer, and that <hi>England</hi> ſhould never be at a Penny charge for his Ranſom, was informed by ſome of his Noble Priſoners, That the <hi>French</hi> were ſo confident of the Victory, that they had not only diſpoſed of his Perſon, and the ſpoil of his Camp before hand, but alſo of Places and Offices in <hi>England: But when Man propoſes, God diſpoſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dead being Honourably Buried, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Inriched with the Spoil, the King Marched to <hi>Callis,</hi> without any interuption; and having ſettled his Affairs, paſſed into <hi>England,</hi> where he was received by his Subjects with unſpeakable Joy.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Captain of <hi>Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtew,</hi> Ravaged the Countries, and Overthrew the Earl of <hi>Arminiack,</hi> the new Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſlaughter; taking many Priſoners, for which he had large Ranſoms: And <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> coming into <hi>England,</hi> laboured to conclude a Peace between the two Kings; but not being able to effect it, he made one for himſelf; and being honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attended by the King and his Nobles to his Ships, he returned home, highly ſatisfied with his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Shortly after the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> made a Peace with King <hi>Henry</hi> only for the Counties of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Arthois,</hi> for which he was ſuſpected as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Kings abſence, the <hi>French</hi> Beſieged <hi>Hareflew</hi> by Sea and Land; but their Fleet, Commanded by <hi>John</hi> Viſcount <hi>Narbon,</hi> was utterly deſtroyed by <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford;</hi> whereupon the Conſtable raiſed the Siege by Land, and haſted to <hi>Paris;</hi> upon which the <hi>French</hi> Nobility Quarelled among themſelves, about the ſeveral
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61951:294"/> bad Succeſſes, charging the Miſcarriage upon one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which made for King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Intereſt; ſo that he called a Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> declaring pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly his Right and undoubted Title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the many wrongs the <hi>French</hi> had done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which now they had an opportunity to repair, in giving him Supplies to enable him in the proſecution of his Wars, which they liberally Granted him; and it was raiſed without any murmurings of the People, as in other Reigns had happened on the like occaſion: In the mean while <hi>John Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> after a ſharp Engagement, took three Carracks of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and ſunk other ſix, that were going to Aid the <hi>French;</hi> and in the Prizes found great ſtore of Treaſure; and early in the Spring the King Landed a ſtrong Army in <hi>Normandy,</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Tonque,</hi> whereupon the Villagers of that Dutchy fled into their Walled-Towns, and he laid Siege to the City of <hi>Caen,</hi> which after many fierce Aſſaults, he took, putting to Death the moſt obſtinate, who had too long refuſed his proffered Mercy, in holding out againſt him; and the more Wealthy Citizens he put to Fines and Ranſoms.</p>
                  <p>And now a Quarrel happened between the Queen of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> her Son, for ſhe having raked together great ſtore of Treaſure, he forcibly ſeized it for the uſe of the War; which ſo enraged her, that ſhe vowed Revenge, and procured <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to be Protector of the Kings Perſon and of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ſo that an irreconcileable Quarrel continued among them: The <hi>Conſtable</hi> and <hi>Dauphin</hi> labouring to weaken his Intereſt, and he on the other hand ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Kings Favour, was not wanting to do the like for them. Whilſt King <hi>Henry</hi> was Warring in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and took in about 50 ſtrong Towns and Caſtles, reducing the <hi>Normans</hi> for the moſt part to his
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61951:295"/> obedience, and having appointed Sir <hi>Gilbert <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mphrevile</hi> Captain of <hi>Caen</hi> Caſtle, and Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> the like of the Town, Sir <hi>John Popham</hi> Baylif, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and diſpoſed the other Places in Truſty Hands, he Marched to <hi>Roan,</hi> where he found the Citizens had drawn a great Trench about it, and ſtrongly Fortified it with Towers and Bullwarks, and having laid Siege to it, at <hi>Pontle-Arch</hi> he laid over a ſtrong Chain, and a Wooden Bridge to hinder any Succours coming by Water, keeping like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that Paſſage blocked up with a ſtrong Squadron, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> and whilſt he lay at this Siege, the Lord <hi>Kilmay</hi> with 16000 <hi>Iriſhmen,</hi> came to him Armed with Darts and Coats of Mail, being joyfully received, and proved very ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. But the King finding his violent Aſſaults were repulſed, the Garriſon being very Numerous, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the place to the Landward, with a wide and deep Trench, impailed at the bottom with ſharp Stakes, and ſo well guarded with Archers, that they durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it; ſo there being Multitudes of uſeleſs People in the City, the Famine encreaſed ſo ſore among them, that nothing Unclean was left uneaten; nor were thoſe they turned out ſuffered to paſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp, ſo that many Hundreds with piteous cries lay and died under the Walls; and the Siege having continued from <hi>Lamas</hi> tide, till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> on <hi>New-Years Day</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſafe Conduct for their Commiſſioners to paſs to the King, which was allowed, but to little purpoſe; for a bold <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſo angered him with his vaunting ſpeech (wherein he taxed him with unprincely dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateneſs, and meanneſs of Courage, for Cloiſtering up the Garriſon to Starve them, as not daring to let them be at liberty to Fight, and ſell their Lives bravely in the Field) That he reſolved not to hearken to any Terms, but the Surrender of the City upon diſcretion,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61951:295"/> Granting them only a Truce of Eight Days to well adviſe in the matter; but nothing being determined, the half-Starved Inhabitants with hideous cries and ſhouts compelled the Governour and Magiſtrates to a Surrender; ſo that having Four Days more allowed, they Surrendered the City and Caſtle to the King, there being Famiſhed during the Siege 5000, and 12000 Starvelings were turned out, who many of them dyed in the Fields and Lanes: Then he compelled the Burghers for their Ranſom to pay him 356000 Crowns and ſwear Fealty to him and his Succeſſors, and with this Capital <hi>City</hi> went the currant of the reſt, ſo that he became ſole Maſter of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> came to King <hi>Henry</hi> under ſafe conduct, to treat of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whatever the <hi>King</hi> asked, was denied; which made him in a paſſion Swear, That he would have the Lady <hi>Catharine</hi> in Marriage, and what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with her, or otherwiſe he would ere long drive both him and his Maſter out of the Kingdom: To which the Duke Replied, Thoſe words were eaſie to be ſpoke, but that he muſt take much Labour and Toil to make them good. After this, the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled himſelf to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> ratified under their Hands and Seals before a publick Notary, and King <hi>Henry</hi> to let the world ſee he reſolved to perſiſt in what he had enterprized, created <hi>Gaſcoyn D' Foyes,</hi> Earl of <hi>Longeville;</hi> Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tankervile;</hi> and Sir <hi>John Bourchier,</hi> Earl of <hi>Ewe</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and upon the approach of Captain <hi>Bueff</hi> with 1500 Men to <hi>Ponthoyſe,</hi> the Lord <hi>Liſtendame,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, with 10000 Inhabitants, Deſerted it, leaving for haſte moſt of their Rich Goods behind them. This Place the King Fortified, and Marched to <hi>Paris,</hi> which he lay before Three Days, bringing a great terror on
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61951:296"/> that City; but with his ſmall Army not able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs it, he Marched back to <hi>Ponthoyſe.</hi>

                     <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> as is ſaid, having reconciled himſelf to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> yet it being ſuperficial, and not hearty, he determined in a more ſubmiſſive manner to humble himſelf unto him, that thereby their Loves taking a deeper root, might bring forth the fruits of Unity and Peace; but when they met, the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> whoſe Mallice was irreconcileable, and whoſe miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jealoſie did perſwade him that the Duke would not be faithful, procured him treacherouſly to be Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by the blow of a Battel-Ax in his preſence, as he was about to kneel and pay him Homage. This was looked on by many as a juſt Judgment, becauſe much in the ſame manner he had cauſed <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to be Murthered in the Tenth Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth.</p>
                  <p>This made not amiſs for King <hi>Henry,</hi> but haſtened his advancement; for <hi>Philip,</hi> Son to the Murthered Duke, was ſo highly diſpleaſed, that he not only in his melancholy Anger determined forever to ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Innocent Dutcheſs, without any other reaſon or cauſe, than that ſhe was Siſter to the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> but as his fury abated, her Tears and the ſober Advice of his Counſellours, brought him to better reaſon; ſo that for that time his Love continued to her as at firſt: Yet he reſolved on Revenge another way, <hi>viz.</hi> By joyning his Intereſt with King <hi>Henry;</hi> for he was very powerful in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as well as <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and was able to give a conſiderable check to <hi>France,</hi> but more eſpecially to the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Intereſt; and to bring this about, he laboured to Reconcile the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and in thoſe his endeavours he was the more powerful,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Almoſt all <hi>France</hi> being reduced to Obedience, the two Kings and Queens took leave; and <hi>Henry</hi> received in his way to <hi>England</hi> Homage of all the Nobles of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and conferring high Honours and Titles on many, came to <hi>Callis,</hi> and from thence Sailed for <hi>England,</hi> where he was Joyfully received; and the <hi>February</hi> following Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> was Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with great Solemnity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> upon King <hi>Henry</hi>'s departure, began to look up a little, and having made the Young Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> his Lieutenant; the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was left Lieutenant for <hi>Henry,</hi> who deceived by one <hi>Andrew Forguſa,</hi> a Treacherous <hi>Lombard,</hi> whom he too much Truſted, thinking to repreſs the <hi>French</hi> Forces, was drawn into their Ambuſh, and after a deſperate Fight againſt four to one, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Overthrown near

                     <hi>Blangy;</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi> loſt 1200 of their choiceſt Men; and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tankervile,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mphervile,</hi> the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> and near 2000 of leſs Note; and taken Priſoners the Earls of <hi>Suffolk, Sommerſet,</hi> and <hi>Perch;</hi> the Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter,</hi> and others: But upon the approach of Sir <hi>Thomas Beaufort</hi> with a Band of Archers, the <hi>French</hi> haſted out of the Field with their Priſoners and Spoil, as having had hot work on it already, and not willing to try a ſecond Encounter.</p>
                  <p>The King was much troubled at this Overthrow, and the death of his Brother; but reſolving Revenge, he ſent the Earl of <hi>Mountague</hi> to ſucceed him in the Command of the Provinces, and aſſembling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſed to be laid before them the State of both Nations; whereupon to enable him in his Wars, the Temporality gave him one Fifteenth, and the Clergy two; and for Expedition, the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced 20000<hi>l.</hi> and received it again out of the Tax Granted by Parliament; whereupon an Army conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 24000 Men was Tranſported under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the King's Brother, driving the <hi>Dauphin</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Chartieres,</hi> from thence the Duke Marched to <hi>Paris,</hi> and was ſoon joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with 4000 Horſe; nor was the King ſlow in following his Army, having with him <hi>James</hi> the Young King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who with his own People Beſieged and Took <hi>Direux,</hi> and delivered it to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and ſo they chaſed the <hi>Dauphin</hi> out of all his ſtrong Holds, compelling him to take Refuge in <hi>Berry,</hi> whither the King thought not fit to tire his Army in following him; but having taken in a great many places, repaſſed the <hi>Loire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> was delivered of a Son at <hi>Windſor;</hi> which News coming to the King,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61951:298"/> very much troubled him, becauſe he had charged her not to Lye-in there; but being unexpectedly taken in Labour, neceſſity compelled her to do it. The King's Reaſon for it, was grounded on an old Prophecy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting <hi>No Prince Fortunate that ſhould be Born there:</hi> Whereupon, in a Paſſion he ſaid to the Lord <hi>Fitz-Hugh,</hi> his Chamberlaine, <hi>Good God!

                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, the King having Reduced the Iſles of <hi>France,</hi> and almoſt all other Places, fell Sick, and unable to Travel: whereupon he committed the charge of the Army to his Brother <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford.</hi> Then calling together his Nobles, and ſending for the Queen, he appointed the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> Regent of <hi>France,</hi> and Lieutenant General of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and his other Brother <hi>Humphry</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Regent of <hi>England,</hi> and Protector of his Son's Perſon; Exhorting the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to maintain the Friendſhip with the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and always to be at Union among themſelves; to be faithful to his Son and Queen, and never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace with the <hi>Dauphin</hi> till he ſubmitted to his Son: Soon after this, he Dyed, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31ſt <hi>Anno</hi> 1422 at <hi>Boice Le Vincenois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> of a Burning Feavour, and Flux, in the 30th Year of his Age, when he had Reigned 9 Years, 5 Months, and 10 Days; and his Body being brought over, was Buried among his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anceſtors at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with extraordinary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>

                     <hi>HENRY</hi> the Sixth, being at the Death of his Father not above three Months Old, a Parliament was ſoon after called, and he Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> at five Months Old, the Queen holding him in her Lap whilſt the Ceremony was performed, and likewiſe brought into the Parliament-Houſe, where the Lords paid Homage to him as their Rightful Soveraign; a Speech on his behalf being made to them by the Queen, Exhorting them to be ſtedfaſt and Unanimous in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61951:301"/> his Right, and oppoſing his Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they promiſed to be, and endeavour to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth Dying, the <hi>French</hi> Nobles began to bethink themſelves, that it ſtood little with their Honour to be ſubject to a Prince of another Nation, whilſt they had a Son of their King amongſt them; and forgeting their Oaths and Fealty, they began on a ſuddain to grow cold towards the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſeemed deſirous to ſhake off their Yoak; of which the Regent giving notice to his Brother in <hi>England,</hi> care was taken continually to ſend him over Men and Money, to compell them, if neceſſity required it, to their Obedience; but firſt he uſed all manner of fair Means, minding them if they perſevered in their Loyalty, the happy concluſion would make them Rich and Fortunate, win to them the Love and Favour of their Young King, as he grew up and increaſed in Wiſdom and Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However the <hi>Dauphin</hi> got himſelf Crowned by his Party, under the Title of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh; and with his ſmall Army took the Field, ſending the Lord <hi>Grandval</hi> to Beſiege <hi>Pont-Melance</hi> on the River <hi>Seine,</hi> which he had the fortune to ſurprize before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon was aware of his coming, putting moſt he found therein to the Sword; but it was ſoon regained by the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Grandval</hi> ſwore Allegiance for his Ranſom, to King <hi>Henry,</hi> but baſely revolted as ſoon as he was Enlarged: Then the Earl took <hi>Senes;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ſued to the New French King to aſſiſt them underhand, tho' at the ſame time they had for a colour ſent ſome of their Citizens to King <hi>Henry,</hi> promiſing a continued Duty and Loyalty, for yet they found not matters ripe for an open Revolt: But whilſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent was Magnificently Celebrating his Nuptials with the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> they

                  <p>Soon after, the defeated Governour of <hi>Yvrie,</hi> whom the <hi>Dauphin</hi> had unworthily made Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> Beſieged St. <hi>James Town</hi> in <hi>Bayon,</hi> with 4000 Men, but the Beſieged iſſuing out with hideous cries of St. <hi>George</hi> and the Earl <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who by his Martial deeds was grown Terrible to the <hi>French,</hi> that Army being ſeized with a fear that the Earl was entered with his Army on the other ſide, and about to break-in upon them, all in confuſion threw away their Arms and fled; ſo a handful of Men purſuing, a great many of them

                  <p>Theſe troubleſome Wars having held a long time, the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> mediated for Peace, which only came to a ſix Years Truce, and yet that was broke much ſooner, upon the death of <hi>Ann,</hi> the Regents Dutcheſs, Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Lady <hi>Jaquet,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> For as much as hereupon the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s Love to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> more and more declined, and the bond of Affinity that tied him more ſtrictly to the Regent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſundered by the Death of his Siſter; and now the <hi>French</hi> taking all advantages, ſecretly conveyed 200 Men into the Caſtle of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy;</hi> but they were Aſſaulted by the Garriſon with ſuch timely Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (for they had been Introduced by the Treachery of the Deputy-Governour, as Friends) that they were beaten into the Dungeon, from whence they were ſentenced ſome to the Gallows, others to a different manner of Death, by Cruel Torments; and thoſe that ſped beſt, were put to great Ranſoms.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Regent took the Field, and being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced by 800 Men at Arms, brought over by the Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> who had ſometime before, by his Ranſom being paid, been ſet at liberty; and often urged the <hi>French</hi> to a Battel, which they declined: In the mean while, the Boors in <hi>Normandy</hi> roſe in a tumultuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, but being Overthrown by the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> about 1000 of them Slain, and ſeveral of their Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Executed, this diſturbance was quieted.

The King upon this fearing the worſt, raiſed likewiſe an Army; whereupon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſent a ſubmiſſive Meſſage and Letter to him, That he intended nothing againſt his Royal Perſon, nor againſt the State, but only craved, That in Parliament the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> might be Tryed, and cauſed to Anſwer to ſuch Crimes as would be Objected againſt him; and the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> upon this, being for ſhew ſake, committed to the Tower, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> diſſolved his Army, and came to the King; where contrary to his expectation, he met with the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> who Accuſed him of Treaſon, for that without the Kings Leave or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, he had raiſed an Army, with which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61951:308"/> to have Murthered his Soveraign, and made himſelf Inheritor and Poſſeſſor of the Crown: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke was Arreſted, but in a few days Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things happened in <hi>England,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Guyan</hi> and <hi>Aquitain</hi> threw off their Subjection to <hi>France,</hi> and ſent ſecret Meſſages to King <hi>Henry,</hi> That if he would furniſh an Army to Protect them, they would re-deliver thoſe Provinces into his Poſſeſſion; upon which, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was ſent with 3000 Men, who received them into the Kings Protection: But ſoon after, being fought with by 20000 <hi>French,</hi> he was Overthrown and Slain, with almoſt all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and thereupon theſe Provinces were utterly Loſt. In the mean while the Queen was delivered of a Son, whom ſhe cauſed to be Named <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> having ſtrengthened his Faction, made grievous Complaints to the Lords in Parliament againſt the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> ſo that in the Queen's Chamber he was Arreſted for High Treaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Tower. But the Parliament being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly Adjourned, and the King by many proteſtations faithfully promiſing, that at ſome other time he ſhould Anſwer thoſe Accuſations, he was ſet at Liberty, and made Captain of the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Callice,</hi> which made the Duke of <hi>York</hi> Leavy another Army, and fought with the King at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and ſo prevailed, that the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> and about 8000 others, were Slain; the King was alſo hurt in the Neck with an Arrow, and taken Priſoner; but uſed with much diſſembled Civility, and brought to <hi>London;</hi> where at the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s entreaty he called a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was made Chancellour, The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Captain of <hi>Callice;</hi> The Duke of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61951:308"/> 
                     <hi>York</hi> was likewiſe appointed Protector of the Kings Perſon, and of the Realm; but the Queen being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he Aimed at the Crown, they were ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe Differences continued, many diſorders happened; The Houſes of Merchant-Strangers were Rifled and Robbed in <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> greatly Annoy'd our Merchants on the Seas, which compelled the Queen (who was Wiſe, Politick, and of a Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Spirit) to uſe a Stratagem, which was to get the King to retire into the North for his Pleaſure, and ſent Letters to the Three Lords immediatly to come and Confer with him, who delay'd not to do it; but having ſecret notice their deſtruction was intended, they timely Fled, and prevented their Ruin. Yet the King adviſed by his grave Counſellours, laboured for an Accommodation of matters, appointing for this purpoſe a General Meeting of all his Lords at <hi>London,</hi> who came ſtrongly Guarded with Friends and Servants, where the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other great Clergymen, uſed ſuch Perſwaſions and Arguments, That the King, Queen, and all the Lords, were pleaſed in friendly and in kind ſort to conſent that all Jars and Diſcontents ſhould be laid aſide; and by Inſtruments in Writing a Reconciliation was outwardly Confirmed, but not with any hearty goodwill on either ſide; yet it greatly Rejoyced the People, who thought it Real. After this, the King rod through the City with the Crown on his Head, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> conducted the Queen, and the Lords of either Faction rod two and two together.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, one of the Kings Servants was Wounded in the Court by a Gentleman belonging to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who eſcaping, the reſt of the Kings Servants fell upon the Earl as he came from the <hi>Council-Table,</hi>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:61951:309"/> but he Eſcaped by Water, and was ſearched after in <hi>London</hi> in order to be ſent to the Tower; yet he was not there but fled into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> complaining to his Father the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> of the Injury that had been done to him; who Adviſed him immediatly to repare to his Government of <hi>Callice</hi> and then the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> raiſed an Army, and Marched towards <hi>London,</hi> of which the Queen had no ſooner notice, but ſhe ſent the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> to oppoſe him; ſo that the Battel being joyned, after a ſharp Fight the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> and 2200 of his Men was Slain, the reſt flying, and leaving <hi>Salisbury</hi> Maſter of the Field; upon this ſucceſs, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> conceiving he ſhould gain what he aimed at, raiſed an Army on the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Joyning with <hi>Salisbury</hi> near <hi>Ludlow,</hi> the King's Army came in ſight of them; but the Lords fearing they were Betrayed by one <hi>Andrew Trollop</hi> and <hi>John Blunt,</hi> two famous Captains, trained up in the <hi>French</hi> Wars, who had been brought over by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> becauſe after they had ſhewed them advantageouſly how to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Kings Army, they had on ſcruple of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence deſerted and gone over to him; raiſed their Camp in the Night, and ſecretly Retiring, disbanded their Army, and ſhifted for themſelves; yet ſeveral of their Captains being Taken, were Executed, but the common Soldiers Pardoned, and the flying Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Arch Traytors to the King and Kingdom; their Goods, Offices, and Lands Sequeſtered to the Kings Uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the King made <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> Slain in the Battel of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> Captain of <hi>Callice;</hi> and now the King on good Advice Aſſembled a Parliament, in which the Lords of the <hi>Yorkiſt</hi>'s Faction were Attainted of High Treaſon; and to prevent the Returning of ſuch as were Fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, the Ports were Fortified, and ſtrictly
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61951:309"/> Guarded; yet they returned, took <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and in a ſhort time raiſed an Army of 25000 Men; with which they Marched towards <hi>London;</hi> to ſecure which, the Lord <hi>Scales</hi> was ſent by the King; but the Lord Mayor refuſed him admittance, ſaying, <hi>He was able to defend the City, and would do it, ſeeing the King had committed it to his charge;</hi> ſo that after many Countermarches, the Army the King had raiſed, and that of the Lords, met near <hi>Northampton,</hi> where the King was Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and taken Priſoner, 2000 of his Men were Slain, and of Note <hi>Humphery</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham, John</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Egremont,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Viſcount <hi>Beamont;</hi> whereupon the Queen, with the Young Prince and Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> fled into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and were kindly received; the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Tower, and the Lord <hi>Seales</hi> attempting to paſs the River in diſguiſe, was diſcovered by the Wherryman, who cut off his Head and left his Body on the Sands; and <hi>Thomas Thorp,</hi> the Second Baron of the Exchequer, ſhaving his Crown, and putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Habit of a Monk, was taken flying to the Queen, and being brought to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> he committed him to the Tower, where he remained a long time after.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> informed of this Victory, haſted from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and procured a Parliament to be Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Kings Name at <hi>London,</hi> where placing himſelf in the Throne, he declared his Right to the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he was Son and Heir of <hi>Ann,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who was Son and Heir to <hi>Philippa,</hi> ſole Daughter and Heireſs to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> Great Grandfather to the preſent <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; and then proceeded to lay before them the Miſchiefs
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61951:310"/> and Loſſes that had befallen the Kingdom by miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Succeſſion, by reaſon God was Angry with them for ſo doing; and to prevent many more he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it might be reſtored in the Direct Line.</p>
                  <p>When the Lords and Commons had deliberated upon this weighty Affair, the contrary Party (more out of fear than conſcience, goodwill, or affection) agreed with the Duke's Faction; and it was Enacted, <hi>That King</hi> Henry <hi>during his Natural Life ſhould retain the Name and Honour of a King; and that the Duke of</hi> York <hi>ſhould be Proclaimed Heir apparent to the Crown, and be Protector of the Kings Perſon and of the Realm, and ſhould have the preſent poſſeſſion of the Crown delivered to him, if at any time King</hi> Henry, <hi>his Friends, Allies, or Favorites, on his behalf attempted to infringe this Act, which was Agreed to and Confirmed by their Oaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> by this means being got near to what he aimed at, required the Queen, the Dukes of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the Lords <hi>Clifford, Roſs,</hi> and others, immediatly to repair from the North, whither they were fled, and confer with the King; but inſtead of ſo doing, being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Proceedings of the Parliament, they Levied an Army and with it advanced towards <hi>London:</hi> The Duke of <hi>York</hi> had ſoon notice of it, and Marched with all ſpeed to oppoſe them, leaving the King in the cuſtody of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> and the two Armies met near <hi>Wakefield:</hi> Where the Duke being too weak, was perſwaded to ſtay for the arrival of <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> his Son, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing from the borders of <hi>Wales</hi> with an Army to Joyn him; but being carried headlong by his forward <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> which deſigned him not to be a King, though he wanted but one ſtep to the Throne, he forthwith gave the onſet; but within an Hours ſpace, almoſt three
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61951:310"/> Thouſand of his Companions were Slain, together with himſelf, and his Youngeſt Son the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> not exceeding 12 Years, who kneeling on his Knees deſired Mercy, but was cruelly Stabbed to the Heart by the Lord <hi>Clifford;</hi> who horribly Swore, <hi>By that Act he would be Revenged for his Fathers Death:</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the reſt of the Army Fled: The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi>'s Head being cut off by thoſe that found him dead in the Field, was preſented to the Queen, who cauſed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Crown to be ſet on it in deriſion, and placed it on the Walls of the City of <hi>York,</hi> Beheading the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and others of his Favorites, who were taken Priſoners, and placing their Heads with his to bear him company.</p>
                  <p>The Queen ſuppoſing now her fears were over by the ſlaughter of her Capital Enemies, Advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> overthrowing the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſuch Forces as he had gathered to oppoſe her, by which means King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſet at Liberty, and Joyfully received by her: But then News came that the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who hearing of his Fathers death, had taken on him the Title of <hi>Duke of York,</hi> had Overthrown the Earls of <hi>Pembrook, Ormond,</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> Beheaded <hi>Owen Tuther,</hi> the King's Father-in-Law, who had Married his Mother the Queen Dowager, and divers others, whoſe Heads he placed in the Room of his Fathers, and other Heads of his Friends, which the Queen had cauſed to be ſet on the Walls of <hi>York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſuddain Turn of Fortune made the Queen draw out her Army and haſten towards him, having raiſed an Army of 60000 Men, and near a Town called <hi>Towton,</hi> the New <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> met her with near 50000; ſo that a cruel and bloody Battel enſued, wherein on both ſides about 36000 were ſlain, among whom were the Earls of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61951:311"/> 
                     <hi>Northumberland, Weſtmorland,</hi> the Lords <hi>Dacres, Wells, Clifford, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> ſaved themſelves by flight, but the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> with ſundry others of Note were made Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Upon this great Overthrow (for it fell on the Kings-ſide, who was always Unfortunate in the Field) he with the Queen and Prince fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were favourably received, and in lieu of their kind Entertainment delivered <hi>Berwick</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> which they much deſired, and attempted often times to gain, tho' beaten off with great loſs; ſo that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> being every where Received as King, may be ſaid here to put an end to <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign (tho' he Lived much longer) when he had Reigned 38 Years, 6 Months, and 3 Days, and was after Stabbed in the Tower by <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths Brother, <hi>Anno</hi> 1471 in the 49th Year of his Age as will appear more largely in the Reign of that King: His Body was firſt Buried in the Abby of <hi>Chertſey</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> then by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> after removed none can tell where, as not being found in Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In this Kings Reign from the beginning of <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Allhallontide,</hi> fell ſuch abundance of Rain that the Corn and Hay Harveſt were utterly ſpoiled, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a dearth among Men and Cattle.</p>

                  <p>The Lord <hi>Montacute</hi> fluſhed with this ſucceſs, and thurſting after fame, without ſtaying for the King, ſet upon Queen <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Army, and after a bloody Fight put her to the Rout; and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Summerſet, William Tallboies</hi> (who ſtiled himſelf Earl of <hi>Kent</hi>) the Lords <hi>Roſs, Mollines</hi> and <hi>Hungerford,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Nevel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Tunſtal,</hi> being Taken, were in ſeveral places Beheaded, and 27 others were ſhortly after Executed in divers manners. But
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61951:315"/> after this Overthrow, <hi>Henry</hi> Eſcaped to <hi>Scotland</hi> with his half-Brother <hi>Jaſper</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Grey,</hi> and others, and hereupon all the Caſtles in the North fell into King <hi>Edward</hi>'s hands.</p>
                  <p>For this Service done by the Lord <hi>Montacute,</hi> the King would have given him the Earldom of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi> but upon that Earls ſubmitting, though he had fought againſt him, he reſtored him to his Lands and Honours, giving <hi>Montacute</hi> in lieu of his Reſignation, the Title of a <hi>Marqueſs;</hi> and to encourage his Soldiers, and ſuch as had deſerved well, he beſtowed on them great Bounties out of the confiſcated Eſtates of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, cauſing many advantagious Laws to be Enacted, the better to ſettle him on the Throne, by gaining the affection of the People. Soon after this, King <hi>Henry</hi> returning diſguiſed into <hi>England,</hi> was diſcovered, taken Priſoner, and ſent to <hi>Edward,</hi> who committed him to cloſe ward in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> now thinking himſelf firmly fixed in the Throne, by the advice of the Eſtates, after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of ſeveral Matches, concluded to ſend his great Friend <hi>Richard Nevill,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to require the Lady <hi>Bona,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Charete</hi> Queen to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> in Marriage; the Earl was ſent over with a very ſplended Equipage, and with many Rich preſents to the Lady; and was ſo proſperous in his Negotiation, that all things he had in Commiſſion were ſoon agreed to, the Portion aſſigned, and the Inſtruments for ſettling her Dowry ratified; but this wrought much miſchief to King <hi>Edward:</hi> For going to Recreate himſelf at his Mannor of <hi>Grafton,</hi> he there caſt his Eyes on the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Widow to Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi> ſlain in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s cauſe at the Battel of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> and by no perſwaſions being able to gain her for his Concubine,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:61951:315"/> though he had freely granted her her Husbands Eſtate, which ſhe Petitioned to him for, ſo enflamed was he with the deſire of Enjoying her, (and ſhe plainly telling him, <hi>As ſhe thought her ſelf of too mean a condition to be his Wife; ſo ſhe thought her ſelf much above his demands of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Concubine; and tho' her Life might be at his diſpoſe, her Chaſtity was not to be violated but with that Cumpulſion that would pull down vengance on his Head</hi>) that laying aſide the thoughts of any other, he Married her; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting all her Kindred to Dignities and Honours, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> her Father Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> and High Conſtable of <hi>England;</hi> her Son Sir <hi>Thomas Grey,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and preferred him and others to Rich Heireſſes of Noblemen, and did many other things for them, that diſpleaſed his neareſt Friends: For no ſooner the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> his Brother heard of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s being greatly diſpleaſed at the Kings having put that affront on him, but they met and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted which way to conſtrain the King to lay aſide theſe new Favourites; and ſo great was the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Anger for the diſgrace the King had made him incur in Foreign Courts, by this Marriage, which utterly diſannulled that which he had treated about, that he caſt nothing in his mind more, than how he might Depoſe him, and Reſtore King <hi>Henry;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conſults with the Marqueſs <hi>Montacute</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and others, were held, to further his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The King (who feared <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Greatneſs and Popularity) was not altogether ignorant of his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, tho' he outwardly diſſembled it as well as he could; and therefore the better to weather the Storm he ſaw coming, tho' as yet at a diſtance, he concluded a Truce for Fifteen Years with the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to weaken the Earl on that ſide; and to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> he ſent (as a Preſent
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61951:316"/> to make Friends with them) about a Hundred <hi>Cotſhall-Sheep,</hi> a thing they never before, nor any of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, upon any Intreaty, or for large ſums offered, could obtain from the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> from which ſmall Number ſuch Multitudes have ſince Encreaſed, as in the Woollen-Trade has turned greatly to our damage. And that he might be the better able to deal with <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> if War by him ſhould be Proclaimed, or he ſhould underhand aſſiſt the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> in any attempt, he made a League with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Hardy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and gave him his Siſter <hi>Margaret</hi> in Marriage, and two other Siſters, to the Dukes of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for all this, <hi>Warwick</hi>'s deſign was cloſely carried on, and it was Agreed among them, That he and the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Callice;</hi> and there to ſtrengthen the Alliance, the Duke ſhould Marry <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Earls Daughter; and in their Abſence, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge or conſent, the Marqueſs <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> and Arch Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> Brothers to <hi>Warwick,</hi> ſhould with the help of their Friends raiſe a Rebellion in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> which they did, by inciting the Ruſticks not to pay Tribute of Corn to the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Leonard</hi> in the City of <hi>York,</hi> which upon refuſal being exacted by the Collectors, commotions aroſe, and at length about 15000 came before the City with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Plunder and Demoliſh that Hoſpital, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by a Sally of the Citizens, they were beaten off, and ſo Marched away towards <hi>Northampton,</hi> Headed by Sir <hi>John Conyers</hi> an Experienced Soldier, but were met by <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Humphry</hi> Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> who by the Kings Command had raiſed Forces in <hi>Wales,</hi> and after they had overthrown 2000 Archers that the Lords had laid in Ambuſh to fall on their Rear, upon a diſſention ariſing between <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61951:316"/> latter withdrew his Forces, ſo that the former with much courage, tho' few in Number, giving the Ruſticks Battel in <hi>Banbury Field,</hi> having near gained the Victory, the Scale of ſucceſs was ſuddainly turned in a ſurpriſing manner, <hi>viz.</hi> One <hi>John Clapham,</hi> a Servant to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> having got his Maſters Standard, in which was Portraied the <hi>White Bear,</hi> coming in with a ſmall Troop, and crying <hi>A Warwick, a Warwick;</hi> ſo daunted the Kings Men (who thought the Earl had been there with a freſh ſupply) that they threw down their Arms and fled; and being hotly Purſued, more than 5000 were ſlain: Sir <hi>Richard Herbert,</hi> and Eight others of Note, being taken Priſoners, were Beheaded at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> by the Ruſticks. Upon this Succeſs, their Army greatly encreaſed, and a ſeparate Party making one <hi>Robin</hi> of <hi>Risdale</hi> their Captain, Plundered the Kings Mannor-Houſe at <hi>Grafton,</hi> and finding there the Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> Father to the Queen, and his Son <hi>John,</hi> they carried them to <hi>Northampton</hi> and Beheaded them; and ſome of the Kings Forces having Taken the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> he loſt his Head at <hi>Bridgwater</hi> for Deſerting the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> at <hi>Banbury</hi> Field.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> and Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> taking the advantage of theſe Troubles, Landed; and with conſiderable Forces put themſelves at the head of the Ruſticks; ſo that by this addition, and <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Great Name in War, they became ſo formidable to the King, that (at the earneſt requeſt of ſome Nobles, who fear'd the deſolation of their Country by ſuch a cruel War as was threatened) he conſented to a Treaty; during which, the King being more careleſs than he ought to have been of his Perſon, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with a ſtrong Band entered his Camp by Night, and having killed the Watch, carried him Priſoner from his Tent to the Caſtle of <hi>Middleham</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> Committing
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61951:317"/> him to the ward of the Arch Biſhop; but ſoon after, having liberty to go a Hunting, he was Reſcued by Sir <hi>William Standley</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Burgh,</hi> who upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate notice lay in Ambuſh behind the Wood with a Troop of Horſe, and immediatly Poſted to <hi>London.</hi> This inwardly vexed the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who thought to draw great Advantages from his Impriſonment: However the Truce continued, and a meeting of both ſides was appointed in the great Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where nevertheleſs the objections of good Deſerts and unthankful Requitals, were with ſuch vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions repeated and maintained by the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> that the King being highly diſpleaſed, with Threats and Fury they parted from each other: The King taking his way to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Confederate Lords into <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> where they raiſed an Army, and placed Sir <hi>Robert Wells,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Wells,</hi> in chief Command over it, as being very expert in Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> had no ſooner notice of this, but he ſent for the Lord <hi>Wells</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Dymock</hi> his Brother-in-Law, commanding them to uſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to bring over Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to his Intereſt; but though they very much laboured to do it, it proved without effect; which ſo angered the King, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his ſollemn promiſe, he cauſed the Heads of the Lord <hi>Wells</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Dymock</hi> to be ſtricken off; which gained him much diſpleaſure of the Nobles and Commons, and haſtned Sir <hi>Robert Wells</hi> to give him Battel ere the Confederate Lords (who wanted but a days March) came up, with the <hi>Lincolnſhire-Men</hi> he commanded; ſo that the King oppreſſing him with his Number, though he fought Valiantly to revenge his Fathers and Unkles Death, his Soldiers at laſt tired out for want of freſh ſupplies, gave way, and ſoon after
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:61951:317"/> fell into a general Rout, throwing away their Coats to run the nimbler; for which reaſon it is to this day called the Battel of <hi>Looſe Coat Field;</hi> and in it were ſlain about 10000; Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and ſome other of Note being taken Priſoners, loſt their Heads.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and other Lords, hearing of this fatal Overthrow, diſtruſting the fidelity of the Army they Commanded, left it ſecretly by Night, and with a ſmall Train took Shipping at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and Sailed till they came before <hi>Callice;</hi> but was denied Enterance by Monſieur <hi>Vaucler,</hi> whom the Earl had left as his Deputy there; for which he was made Captain of the place by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and had a Thouſand Pounds a Year Penſion from the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> And here on Shipboard the Dutcheſs of <hi>Clarence</hi> was brought to bed of a Son, to whom <hi>Vauclear</hi> would not ſend any Neceſſaries, nor ſuffer the Child to be brought on Shore to be Chriſtened; yet Sayling hence to <hi>Diep,</hi> they took by the way a Rich Prize belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Landing were met by the <hi>French King</hi> at the Caſtle of <hi>Amboys</hi> on the River <hi>Loyer,</hi> and highly welcomed, with promiſes of Aſſiſtance; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted to the <hi>French Court,</hi> they found there Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> Prince <hi>Edward</hi> her Son, and <hi>Jaſper</hi> ſometimes Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who had eſcaped a little before out of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with others; where they entered into new Conferences in order to Depoſe King <hi>Edward</hi> and Reſtore King <hi>Henry;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to make his own Party the Stronger, gave his Second Daughter in Marriage to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſoon after the <hi>French King</hi> furniſhing them with Shipping, Men, and ſuch Neceſſaries as they required, leaving Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> and the Prince her Son at the <hi>French Court,</hi> to attend their ſucceſs; they put to Sea, and Landed at <hi>Dartmouth</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> where the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61951:318"/> Earl Marſhalled his Forces, then few in Number, but quickly encreaſed by the Peoples flowing to his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard from all ſides, upon his putting out a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Name, requiring them to repair to his Aid with Money, Victuals, and all things Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the War, and valiantly to fight againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> whom he ſtiled a Uſurper, and bloody Tyrant, untruly and falſly calling himſelf <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having by this time muſtered a powerful Army, he Marched it towards <hi>London:</hi> The King was not idle at this Juncture, but with what Army he could gather on the ſuddain, Marched to give the Earl Battel; yet on the way hearing that in all the places where his Enemies came, the People applauded them, and no cry was heard but <hi>King Henry</hi> and <hi>a Warwick,</hi> and having little confidence in his own Soldiers, by the wavering he found in them; notwithſtanding his wonted courage, his Heart now failed him: Whereupon in the Night taking with him about 800 of his Friends he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, he left the Army, and poſted into <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> but finding nothing there in a readineſs to advantage him, he took Shipping and Sayled for <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo paſſed to <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where he was kindly received by the Duke his Brother-in-Law.</p>
                  <p>Upon this the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> was taken out of the Tower, and carried in Triumph to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, where having paid his Devotions, and made his Offerings, he was convey'd to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Palace, where he kept his Court, with much Bounty and Magnificence; and a Parliament being aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in his Name, in it <hi>Edward</hi> and all his principal Adherents, were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of High Treaſon, their Goods and Poſſeſſions Confiſcated to King <hi>Henry;</hi> and by the ſame Authority the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was declared to be the next Heir
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61951:318"/> to <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> tho' his Second Son, and the Dutchy of <hi>York</hi> was ſetled on him and his Heirs: Alſo the Crown entailed to King <hi>Henry</hi> and the Heirs Male of his Body; and for want of ſuch Iſſue, to the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> and his Heirs Male; and ſuch as had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed for <hi>Henry</hi>'s Cauſe, were reſtored to their Titles and Eſtates: <hi>Clarence</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> were ſtiled the Kings beſt Friends, Patriots of their Country, and made chief Rulers in all things under <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon notice of this great Revolution, Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> and her Son came over; but long they had not been here, ere <hi>Edward</hi> furniſhed by the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> with Ships, Men, and Warlike Stores, Landed at <hi>Ravenſpurg</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> declaring he came not now for the Kingdom, but to poſſeſs himſelf of the Dutchy of <hi>York,</hi> his Rightful Inheritance, on which he intended as a Subject to live Peaceably; which drew many to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his Cauſe; but having got admittance into that City, he ſoon diſcovered other Intentions: For tho' a little before he had Sworn the contrary to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Gariſoned it with his own Soldiers, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money of them to raiſe more Forces, and ſo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards <hi>London,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Montacute,</hi> who was ſent to oppoſe him, let him paſs; whereupon he cauſed himſelf to be Proclaimed King, ſetting up the Royal Standard: This obliged the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Oxford,</hi> and divers other Nobles, to raiſe an Army, and advance to give him Battel, but the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> Marching another way, with a ſeparate Army, being reconciled to his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> and joyning his Army with him, the Earl thought fit at that time to take other meaſures, not harkening to any fair Words or large Promiſes, to draw him from King <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſide, but bitterly inveighed againſt the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He had always rather be an Earl firm to his Word
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61951:319"/> and Oath, than a Perjured Duke, tho' in hopes of a Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> being now very much ſtrengthened, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>London,</hi> whilſt <hi>Warwick</hi> was raiſing more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and being with ſome difficulty received by the Citizens, he ſent King <hi>Henry</hi> again to the Tower; yet having continual News of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s approach, he drew out his Forces, and Encamped near <hi>Barnet,</hi> about Ten Miles from <hi>London,</hi> having King <hi>Henry</hi> as a pledg with him, fearing if he had left him in the Tower, the <hi>Londoners</hi> in his Abſence would have ſet him at Liberty; and the next Morning the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> reſolving to throw all on the fortune of a Battel, drew up in Battel Array, <hi>viz.</hi> The Right Wing he gave to the Marqueſs his Brother, and the Earl of <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Main Battel to the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and others; the Left Wing was Commanded by himſelf and the Duke of <hi>Exeter;</hi> the Vant-Guard of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Army was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Main Battel by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> in which was King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th; the Rear-Guard by the Lord <hi>Haſtings;</hi> and after they had confronted each other a little ſpace, and both Generals made moving Orations to animate their Soldiers, the Trumpets ſounded the Charge, and they ruſhed together with great fury, fighting five or ſix Hours ſo deſperately, that Victory ſeemed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to no ſide, whilſt the City of <hi>London</hi> was greatly amazed and terrified with various Reports of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſucceſs: But at length the Earl perceiving freſh ſupplies continually preſs on his weary Soldiers, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by his Example to give them new Courage, he diſmounted; and with his Sword in his Hand preſſed into the Front of his Enemies, making miſerable ſlaughter: But breaking in too far, and not being timely ſuccoured, he was ſlain; together with the Marqueſs his Brother, who threw himſelf into the opening Jaws of Death, in hopes to bring the Earl off.</p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:61951:319"/>
                  <p>Theſe great Commanders ſlain, the Army grew faint, and giving way by degrees, at length fell into a total rout, about 10000 being ſlain; and of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Part, of Note, only Sir <hi>Humphry Bourcher</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Barns;</hi> and the dead Bodies of the Earl and Marqueſs being brought to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, were expoſed to view three Days, and then Honourably Interred among their Anceſtors in the Priory of <hi>Biſſam.</hi> Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> having notice of this Defeat, fled with her Son to the Abbey of <hi>Bewley</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> whither divers Lords reſorted to her, and agreed to raiſe new Forces, and try the fortune of another Field, which they did, and were Overthrown at <hi>Tewxbury;</hi> about 3000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, and of Note the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lewkner,</hi> Sir <hi>John Delves, &amp;c.</hi> The Priſoners of Note were the Queen and Prince, the Prior of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Jervis Cliffton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Triſtram,</hi> and Twelve others of Note; all but the two firſt being Beheaded the next day; and ſoon after Prince <hi>Edward</hi> being preſented to the King by Sir <hi>Richard Crofts</hi> who took him Priſoner, was piteouſly Murthered in his ſight, by the Dukes of <hi>Clarence, Glouceſter,</hi> and others, on the ſignal given by the King, in ſtriking him on the Mouth with his Gantlet; nor was it long after, that Innocent King <hi>Henry</hi> was Murthered in the Tower by the ſame Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who ſtruck a Dagger to his Heart; his Body being afterward expoſed to view in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, three days, that the People might be ſure he was Dead; however theſe Proceedings cauſed the King much hatred among the People; when ſomewhat to ſatisfie them, he conſented to Ranſome the Queen, to pay which the poor Prince her Father ſold his Titles to <hi>Jeruſalem, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> and returning home ſhe Lived a Melancholy and Diſconſolate Life, which laſted not long ere ſhe dyed of Grief, particularly for the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61951:320"/> Death of the Prince her Son, whom ſhe dearly Loved.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> by Bloodſhed being rid of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt oppoſers, took ſollace in Pleaſures, being very Luſtful, and was rarely without two or three Concubins, tho' his Queen was Young and Beautiful; and among them <hi>Jane Shoar,</hi> Wife to <hi>Mathew Shoar,</hi> a Goldſmith in <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet,</hi> was moſt pleaſing to him; though in the end it brought her to ſhame and miſery. But to paſs this over,</p>
                  <p>The King being now as I may term it Eſtabliſhed in the Throne, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> vehemently incited him to War on <hi>France,</hi> and recover it as his Antient Right and Inheritance; upon which condition himſelf promiſed to do great matters towards aſſiſting him. The King was not ſlow in liſtening to it, for many reaſons urged by his Council; as, The <hi>French</hi> having frequently aſſiſted his Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet Money being wanting, it ſeemed difficult. But to ſurmount this, he reſolved without a Parliament to ask it of his Subjects, as a Free Gift; which many indeed complied with, tho' with an ill will. But one thing in this is Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, The King to oblige them to bring in more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not for Love, yet for fear of after-claps, on Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws, ſeeing many that were Rich had engaged their Perſons or Purſes in the War againſt him, he ſat ſundry Hours in a Day to receive it himſelf; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, a Rich yet Nigardly old Widow brought Twenty Pounds, this ſo highly pleaſed him, That he not only returned her thanks, but told her <hi>For her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe ſhould Kiſs a King;</hi> and having performed it once, the Old Woman pull'd out another Bag, crying <hi>

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> having gained this main Point, delayed not to haſten his meeting the King, taking with him the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and a ſtrong Guard, and by this time the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> had brought the King to <hi>Stoney-Stratford;</hi> but becauſe that little Town could not accommodate his Train, the Earl took up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Northampton,</hi> about ten Miles from thence; where unlooked-for, the Dukes of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> came into their Inn, and courteouſly ſaluted them; but the Scene was ſoon changed; for they were no ſooner in their Beds, but the two Dukes ſeized on the Keys of the Inn, cauſing the Ways between the two Towns to be ſtopped, and ſtrongly Guarded; pretending for excuſe, that no Man before them ſhould
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61951:326"/> in the Morning pay his humble Duty to the King: Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> having notice of this, perceived he was over-reached and inſnared by <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s Policy; and reſolving to make the beſt of it, diſſembling his fears, came to the two Dukes, and demanded in a forced Jocoſe way, Why they had ſo done? But in ſtead of giving any ſatisfactory Anſwer, they fell into a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Quarrel with him; and cauſing him to be Arreſted, and put under ſtrict Ward, haſtned early the next Morning to <hi>Stoney-Stratford,</hi> and in a ſubmiſſive manner preſented their humble Duty to the King, who received them with much kindneſs and affection, as being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what had paſſed: But this Scene was likewiſe changed, upon their Arreſting the Lord <hi>Richard Grey,</hi> the Kings half Brother, and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> in his preſence; of which uſage when he complained, they told him all ſhould be well; and what they did, was for the beſt; proteſting abundance of Love and Loyalty. However, they ſent the Lords and Knights to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle in the North, under a ſtrong Guard, out of which they came not Alive: Then they removed from the King all his Officers, and placed Creatures of their own about him, giving out that thoſe of the <hi>Queens Blood</hi> intended to deſtroy all the Kings neareſt Relations, and to Rule both Him and the Kingdom at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Queen who lay at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> hearing this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected News, greatly grieved that ſhe had been over-reached by <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s cunning to Write to the Lords to diſmiſs their Strength; and fearing the worſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with her Son <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and her five Daughters, into the Sanctuary. In the mean while they brought the much diſcontented King to <hi>London,</hi> where he was received by the Lord Mayor and 500 Citizens in their Formalities: In whoſe preſence <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> plaid his part ſo cunningly, that not only they
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61951:327"/> but the Nobility were won to believe him ſincere; and thereupon he was appointed Protector of the Kings Perſon and Kingdom: Which Truſt he moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſired, to further his main Deſign, which now he queſtioned not to bring about, if he could get the Duke of <hi>York</hi> into his poſſeſſion; and in order to it, calling a Council of Nobles and Prelates, he laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them how diſgraceful it was that the Queen in her perverſneſs ſhould keep an Innocent Prince in Sanctuary, which was looked on as a place ſuitable to protect the Guilty; that it would cauſe them to be ſpoke evil of abroad, and therefore deſired them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe how they might get him out of her hands, to ſolace and ſport in the company of the King his Brother, who was Melancholy for his abſence, and paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee him.</p>
                  <p>This, and much more to the ſame effect, made them think the Dukes words Reaſonable, and thereupon agree to ſend ſuch as had greateſt Intereſt with the Queen, to perſwade her to deliver him; of whom the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was to be Spokeſman, who laid many Reaſons before her of the Neceſſity at that juncture which required her conſent: But with Sighs and Tears ſhe Replied, <hi>That the Duke being Sickly and Weak, none was more fit than his own Mother to look to him; that Brothers (when together) rarely ſo well agreed as with thoſe that were not ſo near a kin. But the main is,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>my Lord, it is dangerous that theſe Princes, as Affairs ſtand, ſhould be together; ſince aſunder they are each others ſafety. And if the one of them do well, the other cannot be in Peril or Danger; and there is nothing more hazardous than to keep them in one place; ſince the Life of the one ſeparate, is maintained in the Body of the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for all theſe Reaſons, perceiving he would be
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61951:327"/> forced from her, if ſhe conſented not willingly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, after many tender Kiſſes and falling Tears, praying Almighty God to preſerve and defend him from all dangers, ſhe delivered him; bitterly Weeping to the Arch Biſhop, ſaying, <hi>That before the High Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven, ſhe ſhould require that poor Innocent Infant at his Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Protector, who with many Nobles waited in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> was over-joyed when he ſaw the Arch-Biſhop return with what he ſo paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and taking the Young Duke in his Arms, he kiſſed him, and ſaid, <hi>Welcom, my Lord, with all my Heart:</hi> Proteſting ſo great a love to him, that moſt believed it real.</p>
                  <p>Thus having gotten the Prize he aimed at, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſecure it, he conveyed both him and the King in great State through the City of <hi>London</hi> to the Tower, in order as he pretended to the Coronation when things were ſetled; tho' indeed there was nothing out of frame but what himſelf had diſordered; where having placed them under ſuch as he confided in, he began more openly to tamper with the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> whom he knew was Popular and Powerful, offering to Marry his Son to his Daughter, and give him the Earldom of <hi>Hartford</hi> (which the Duke claimed in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time as his Right, but could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) if he would to the utmoſt endeavour to place the Crown on his Head; and by this means he won him entirely to his Intereſt, tho' it afterward proved to his deſtruction: For <hi>Glouceſter</hi> being made King, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing of his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The next thing he had to do, was to gaine the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who had been in high favour with <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and was now Lord Chamberlain to the Young King; but fearing to diſcloſe his mind openly
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61951:328"/> to him, for great Rewards he procured one <hi>Catesby,</hi> a Favourite of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> ſecretly with dark diſcourſe to ſound him: This Man, tho' he had been maintained by that Lord, and had his Fortunes raiſed to what he was by him, proved ſo Treacherous, that having done what he could, and finding that Lord no ways inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to favour <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s deſign, he not only told him of it, but encouraged him to remove him out of the World, if he intended to compaſs his deſires: Which being Reſolved on, he called a Grand Council of Lords at the Tower, to conſider of ſuitable preparations for the Coronation; and when they had ſat a conſiderable time, he came in and took his Chair, Jeſting with ſome of them, after he had excuſed his too long ſtay, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ſome Strawberries that grew in his Garden at <hi>Holbourn;</hi> which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſent for, and took it as a favour that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was ſo kind to him, as to put it in his power to oblige him in any thing; for there had been formerly no good underſtanding between them. Then making excuſe for a ſhort Abſence, he deſired them to proceed in the method propoſed; when about an hour after, coming in, he took his Chair, frowning, biting his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> diſpleaſure ſtrangely amazed them, ſo that they kept a profound ſilence; which the Protector perceiving, demanded what puniſhment they deſerved who had wickedly procured his deſtruction, he being Unkle and Protector of the King? This amuſed them more than before; but knowing themſelves Innocent of any ſuch intention, the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who by reaſon of the antient Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that had been between them, thinking he might make bold, Replied, <hi>My Lord, ſuch as have ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, deſerve the ſevereſt Puniſhment the Law can inflict:</hi> To which the other Lords Aſſented: <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61951:328"/> 
                     <hi>that Sorcereſs</hi> (meaning the Queen) <hi>and</hi> Shoars <hi>Wife, having Conſpired by Witchcraft to deſtroy me:</hi> So draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Sleeve, he ſhewed his Arm, which had been waſted from his Infancy, as they all knew, as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of what he had ſaid; biding them behold how their Charms had begun already to take effect on him. Hereupon the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who had taken <hi>Jane Shoar</hi> to his Bed, upon the Death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> thinking to excuſe her, ſaid, <hi>My Lord, if they have done ſo, they deſerve puniſhment: Thou Traytor,</hi> Replyed the Protector, <hi>Serveſt thou me with Iffs and Ands? I tell thee they have done it; and that I will make good upon thy Body:</hi> And ſo ſtriking his Fiſt upon the Table, the Room was preſently filled with Armed Men, one of which ſtruck at the Lord <hi>Standley,</hi> and as nimble as he was to ſink under the Table, grievouſly Wounded him in the Head, and himſelf Arreſted the Lord <hi>Haſtings;</hi> biding him make haſt to ſhrive himſelf; <hi>For by St.</hi> Paul (which was his uſual Oath) <hi>he would neither Eat nor Drink till his Head was off:</hi> And accordingly he was Beheaded on a Log on the Green within the Tower; and the ſame day by the Protectors order, the Lords, and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> were Beheaded at <hi>Pomfret;</hi> to whoſe Death this Lord had conſented, as appears by his own Story to one <hi>Haſtings</hi> a Prieſt, whom he met on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> as he was going to the Council, <hi>viz. That he ſhould ſoon hear that Snare they had laid for him in</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourths time, which cauſed him much trouble, would now take themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One thing more is remarkable, The Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> the Night preceding, Dreamed That he and <hi>Haſtings</hi> were Wounded by a Boar, that the Blood run about his Ears; and ſeeing the Protector had the White Boar for his Cognizance, he truly Interpreted it, deſiring he would accompany him in Flying, ere they could be
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:61951:329"/> miſſed, out of his reach; but he made ſlight of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Meſſenger to tell his Lord, That Dreams were Fables and Fancies; yet at his Death he repented he had not taken this warning as ſent from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The Protector having Impriſoned the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> Cardinal, Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, put himſelf and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> into old Armour, as if firſt come to hand, in ſome great danger; and ſending for the Lord Mayor, and many of the chief Citizens, movingly told them, <hi>That himſelf and the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>were by Conſpiracy of</hi> Haſtings <hi>and his Accomplices to have been Murthered at the Council Table, had he not by force prevented it; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to make that report to their Neighbours; and that this was all that had occaſioned the Diſturbance and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the Tower:</hi> Nor had <hi>Haſtings</hi> been dead above two Hours ere a large Proclamation, with the Broad Seal to it, was read in divers parts of the City by a Herauld at Arms; ſo that it was plain to the People, that this matter was not ſuddain, but premeditated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Advances coming near the Throne, the Citizens were Aſſembled at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and the matter openly propoſed to them by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who uſed many Arguments to induce their conſent to the Proclaiming <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> King, and lay aſide King <hi>Edwards</hi> Line; but they appeared little inclinable to it. However Dr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> Brother to the Lord Mayor, in a Sermon at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Magnified him as a Prince of the greateſt Magnanimity and Virtue imaginable; labouring to Baſtardize <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and all the other Sons of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> except this <hi>Richard,</hi> who he ſaid was his own Picture, and the true imitator of his Valour and Virtues: Which was taken for ſuch a piece of Diſſimulation and Flattery, that he being afterwards very evilly ſpoken of, he was aſhamed ever after to appear in a Pulpit.</p>

                  <p>This weighty matter being now brought to a home puſh, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to finiſh the work he had begun, carried divers Citizens of the meaner ſort to <hi>Baynards Caſtle,</hi> where the Protector kept his Court; where he made them ſeem to impoſe the Crown on him; with threats, if he refuſed it, to place it on the Head of ſome Nobleman not of the Family of the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenets,</hi> for they would not have any of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Line to Rule over them: This and much more to the like purpoſe, the Duke ſpoke for them, which with a faint ſhout of <hi>God ſave King Richard,</hi> made him with great unwillingneſs (as appeared to them) accept what he had ſo hard laboured for, and paſſionately deſired: And thus an end was put to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth's Reign, if I may ſo terme it, two Months and thirteen Days after his Fathers Death; and was afterward, together with his Brother, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Tower; as will appear in the next Reign.</p>

                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> knowing his Title to be bad, laboured by Favours and Intereſt to ſtrengthen it: He Created his Son about Ten Years of Age, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>John Howard</hi> (a Man of great Experience in feats of Arms) Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, Earl of <hi>Surry:</hi> The Lord <hi>William Barkley</hi> was Advanced to the Earldom of <hi>Notingham;</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Lovel,</hi> his great Crony and Favourite, was made Viſcount <hi>Lovel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, as he immagined, having ſettled his Eſtate ſecurely at Home, he ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> to conclude a Peace with him; thereby to prevent Storms from Abroad: But that Prince ſo far deteſted his proceedings with his Nephews, That he would not admit his Ambaſſadors to his Preſence, nor own him for a King: This much perplexed him, and as is thought put him upon the Project of Murthering the Young Innocent Princes, as ſuppoſing by what had paſſed at the <hi>French Court,</hi> he could never be Reputed and truly Honoured as a King, whilſt they Lived; and that their Murther might not be imputed to him, he purpoſely took a Progreſs to viſit the City of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> from whence he ſometimes took his Title; and from thence ſent his Letters to Sir <hi>Robert Brakenbury</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower, whom he had raiſed from a Low Degree to a conſiderable Fortune, expreſsly Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to make away the two Princes: But either fear of after-claps, or his abhorrence of ſo villanous a Deed, made him abſolutely refuſe it: Upon notice whereof <hi>Richard</hi> ſtormed, and appeared much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61951:331"/> in Mind; retiring himſelf for ſome Hours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how it might be done; and then remembering there was one Sir <hi>James Terril,</hi> a retainer to the <hi>Tower,</hi> whom he knew to be very Indigent and Neceſſitous, this Man he doubted not to prevail on for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wicked purpoſe; and therefore ſent him a ſupply of Money, with large promiſes of preferment, if he Executed his pleaſure; and withal his Commands to the Lieutenant to deliver him the Keys of the <hi>Tower.</hi> This wicked wretch not weighing the Guilt, cloſed with the Golden offers, and had the Keys delivered to him, tho' not without regret, by Sir <hi>Robert Brakenbury;</hi> and the ſame Evening he hired two deſperate Ruffians, <hi>viz. John Dighton</hi> and <hi>Miles Forreſt,</hi> to Smother the Princes in their Beds, which they as wickedly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by claping Pillows on their Faces, and lying on them with all their force, till by their no longer ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they found they had bereaved them of Life.</p>
                  <p>This cruel Murther being committed, the next thing was to conſider how to diſpoſe of their Bodies; which after ſome conſults about it, they Buried under the Stairs, from whence they were removed, and Buried none knows where: Thus King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Male Iſſue, became extinct; which ſome looked on as a Judgment, for his conſenting to the Murther of Pious King <hi>Henry,</hi> and Innocent Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son. However it alleviates not the Guilt of thoſe that dipt their hands in this Blood; for all that were concerned in it, came to untimely ends; ſo juſt and ſevere is God in puniſhing Murther, even in this Life; for rarely wee find his vengance ſtays till the ſhedders of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood drop into a timely Grave.</p>

The Queen grew Frantick for ſome time, and much ado they had to prevent her laying violent hands on herſelf; but being brought to her Sences, with Tears and bitter Excecrations againſt her wicked Brother-in-Law, ſhe paſſed a Melancholy Life for many Months: King <hi>Richard</hi> after this, was troubled with fears and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dreams of Devils and Spirits, haling and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, that he is ſaid to ſhed ſome Tears, and wiſh it had not been done: However he came to <hi>London</hi> and ſummoned a Parliament, wherein (to ingratiate with the People) many good Laws were made, which are highly in Eſteem to this day: But God ſhew'd him an early token of his diſpleaſure, by taking away his only Son, being all the Children he had, he falling from a Horſe dyed of the Bruiſe.</p>

                  <p>This Storm that threatened Ruine to the Uſurper, rouſed him to Arms; ſo that Levying a conſiderable Army, he Marched againſt the Duke, to give him Battel ere he joyned his Friends, ſuppoſing if he could rout him, the reſt would ſoon be Subdued: The Duke was as reſolute as he, and intended to paſs the <hi>Severn</hi> at a low Ford near <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to meet him; but that Night and for Ten days after, ſuch abundance of Rain fell, that the River over-flowed its Banks, drowning all the Meadows, ſo that he could not paſs; and by lingering his Victuals growing ſcanty, moſt of his Forces left him; which unexpected misfortune made him ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when coming to the Houſe of one <hi>Humphery Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> near <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> who had been his Steward, and got a good Eſtate under him, he was there ſheltered for a time; but King <hi>Richard</hi> Proſcribing him, and ſetting a Thouſand Pounds on his Head, that Treacherous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant diſcovered him to the Sherif of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> who apprehended him in poor Apparel, digging in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and conveyed him to the King at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where in hopes of favour, he made an ample confeſſion, but it availed not; for without any Legal Proceedings he was Beheaded, upon which the reſt diſperſed.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> knowing nothing of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, having gotten ſome Forces of the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> put to Sea for <hi>England;</hi> but by contrary winds was driven into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where the <hi>French King</hi> not only ſuccoured him with Money and other Neceſſaries, but gave him ſafe conduct through his Territories to <hi>Britany,</hi> where he found a great number of his Friends

King <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean while was buſied in Fortifying the Sea-Ports, and cutting off by terrible Executions all that he thought favoured the Earls Intereſt, getting him and his adherents attainted in Parliament, ſo that he ſeized their Lands and Effects, beſtowing them on his Creatures, which cauſed much murmuring among the People: And one <hi>Collingborn</hi> an Eſquire of good Eſtate, being in a Poetical ſtrain, reflecting on <hi>Richard</hi>'s three Favourites, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Ratcliff,</hi> Sir <hi>William Catesby,</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>Lovel,</hi> in this Diſtich,

                  <p>AFter the Battel of <hi>Boſworth, Henry</hi> haſted to <hi>London;</hi> and ſoon after his arrival, was Crowned King: Then calling a Parliament, King <hi>Richard</hi> was Attainted, and the Crown entailed on him and his Heirs; and the <hi>January</hi> following, he Married the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Eldeſt Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, by which means the long Warring Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> were joyned in one; and in the enſuing <hi>September,</hi> ſhe was delivered of a Prince, who was Chriſtned <hi>Arthur;</hi> and the King publiſhed his Pardon to all that had born Arms againſt him; conditionally if they would Swear Fealty and Allegiance to him; which many refuſed, and had their Goods and Eſtates Confiſcated. Then he choſe Grave and Wiſe Counſellours of State, who by their prudent mannagment of Affairs, thorowly ſettled the Kingdom in Peace and Tranquillity; and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61951:338"/> ſo proceeding to make large amends to the Duke of <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>French King,</hi> for the favours he received from them during his Exile.</p>
                  <p>But now whilſt all things ſeemed quiet, and Trade began to flouriſh, a ſuddain Rebellion broke out in the North, Headed by Sir <hi>Humphry Stafford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lovel,</hi> and others, who left their Sanctuaries, and drew great Numbers to ſide with them. But King <hi>Henry</hi> raiſed an Army with much celerity, and coming ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on them, the Ringleaders fled by Night, which ſo amazed the <hi>Plebeans,</hi> that the next Morning they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Kings mercy: However Sir <hi>Humphry Stafford,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Thomas,</hi> were taken out of <hi>Culuham Abby</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> whither they had fled for Sanctuary, and the firſt Beheaded; the latter being ſpared becauſe he Acted by the Dictates of his Brother.</p>
                  <p>This combuſtion was no ſooner over, but another more dangerous enſued: For one <hi>Richard Symond,</hi> a Prieſt, ſet up a Pupil of his, whom he had cunningly Inſtructed to claim the Crown, by the Name of <hi>Edward Plantagenet,</hi> Eldeſt Son to the Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> tho' it afterward appeared his true Name was <hi>Lambert Symnel:</hi> His Age agreed with that of the Prince he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, who was then a Priſoner, and in likneſs he reſembled him, and his carriage was extreamly Genteil and Taking; ſo that many flocked to him who were deſirous of change, as well of the Nobles and Gentry, as Commons; but not finding here a ſufficient Strength, he failed to <hi>Ireland;</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Garendine,</hi> the Lord Chancelor, eſpouſed his Quarrel, and drew many to take part with him; and to him the Dutcheſs Dowager, a mortal Enemy to King <hi>Henry,</hi> ſent ſupplies of Money, Men and Arms; and by her Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many <hi>Engliſh</hi> eſpouſed his Intereſt, ſo that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very Formidable: This conſtrained King <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:61951:338"/> to bring the true <hi>Edward</hi> out of the Tower, and carry him through the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> to ſatisfy the People of the Impoſture; where the Nobility were required to be preſent, and to confer with him. But this did little, for the others Army encreaſing, The King raiſed Forces to repel him, and a Battel was joyned near <hi>Stoke</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> which was maintained with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who compoſſed the greater part of <hi>Symnel</hi>'s Army, being deſtitute of Warlike Weapons, tho' they fought valiantly, were routed; whereupon the reſt gave way: And in this Battel the Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lovel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Garendine, Marian Swart,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Browghton,</hi> were Slain, <hi>Symnell</hi> was taken Priſoner, and after a publick Confeſſion who he was, made Scullion in the Kings Kitchen, and after that his Faulconer.</p>
                  <p>Peace now being ſettled, the Queen was Crowned, and <hi>Thomas Bourcher,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> was preferred to that Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal See, and made Lord Chancelor of <hi>England:</hi> ſoon after which preferment, he was dignified with the Hat and Habit of a Cardinal, by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things Paſſed, a Quarrel aroſe between <hi>Charles</hi> the French King, and <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Britany;</hi> whereupon the latter, too weak to oppoſe his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy, required Aid of King <hi>Henry;</hi> but he having in his neceſſities been befriended by them both, rather laboured to make an Accomodation; yet underhand, the King winking at it, many <hi>Engliſh</hi> went over to the Duke's Aſſiſtance; but were moſtly ſlain in a fatal Overthrow the <hi>French</hi> gave near the City of <hi>Nantz,</hi> with their chief Leader the Lord <hi>Woodvile.</hi> This made King <hi>Henry</hi> openly aſſiſt the Duke with Men and Money; to furniſh which, he raiſed by Parliament a
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:61951:339"/> Tax of the Tenth Penny on all Moveable Goods, which cauſed a Rebellion in the North, where the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> enforcing the Kings Orders for the ſtrict Levying it, was Murthered by the Rout; but <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> going againſt them with an Army, they diſperſed and fled; yet ſeveral of the Ringleaders were taken and Executed in ſundry places.</p>
                  <p>During the War in <hi>Britany,</hi> That Duke dyed, and the Eſtates Marrying his Daughter and Heireſs to the French King, tho' ſhe had before been contracted to <hi>Maximillian</hi> the Emperour, a Peace enſued; and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to the Emperour, whom the French King had taken as his Wife, was returned with diſgrace; which occaſioned a War between them; and <hi>Henry</hi> being on both ſides ſolicited for Aid, he for many waighty Reaſons adhered to the Emperour, and Tranſported an Army under the Command of his Unkle <hi>Jaſper</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford;</hi> but the Emperour not being forward in his promiſed Preparation, the King paſſed into <hi>France,</hi> and laid Siege to <hi>Bullen,</hi> which made the French King for fear of <hi>Britany,</hi> of which by his Marriage he was become Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, ſue for Peace; which was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and King <hi>Henry</hi> during their Lives: The French King, for defraying his Charges, paying 186200<hi>l.</hi> and a Yearly Penſion of 25000 Crowns, which was Paid during King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Life; whereupon he returned with his Army.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> ſet up another Impoſture, who though his true Name was <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> was to paſs for <hi>Richard Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet,</hi> the ſecond Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and the better to further her deſign, ſhe uſed ſuch Policy in <hi>England,</hi> that ſhe gained many of the beſt Rank, who were well affected to the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> to favour him.

Yet with this the Storm blew not over, for the Native <hi>Iriſh</hi> declaring for <hi>Perkin,</hi> tho' the King ſent an Army thither under Sir <hi>Edward Poinings,</hi> yet he could do little good there, they being too nimble for him in their Woods, Bogs, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and not being aſſiſted by the Nobles and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as he expected, the fault was charged by him on the Earl of <hi>Killdare,</hi> whom he brought over Priſoner; but that Lord ſo well acquitted himſelf, that he was ſoon ſet at Liberty, and ſent back again with Honour and Rewards; and <hi>Perkin</hi> putting to Sea, Landed in <hi>Kent;</hi> but he was beaten off, and a great many of his Men ſlain; and ſuch as were taken, Executed; which diſcouragement made him return to <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Yet ſoon after he Sailed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was received with Promiſe of large Aſſiſtance; but not finding it according to his expectation, he paſſed thence into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was highly welcomed by <hi>James</hi> the Fourth, who eſteeming him (by reaſon of his Courtly Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) as the True Prince he repreſented, Married him to <hi>Catharine Gourdon</hi> his Neice; and then with a Puiſſant Army Invaded <hi>England,</hi> which miſerably waſted the Northern Borders, and compelled King <hi>Henry</hi> to ſet forward with all the Forces he on the ſuddain could raiſe, under the Command of <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeny;</hi> but was ſoon recalled upon an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> occaſioned by the Levying a Tax to ſupport the War: They ſtrongly charging the fault on <hi>John Morton</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and Sir <hi>Reynold Bray,</hi> who (as they ſaid) to Inrich themſelves had adviſed the King to oppreſs his Subjects; deſiring they might be removed from their Dignities &amp; Offices, and Puniſhed as Enemies to the Common Weale; and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61951:341"/> choſe for their Captains <hi>Thomas Flammock</hi> a Lawyer, and one <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Blackſmith; and gathering as they Marched, brought a great Terrour on the City of <hi>London,</hi> being joyned by the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> and many Thouſands he brought to their aſſiſtance; and found a free paſſage till they came into <hi>Kent,</hi> where the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhmen</hi> oppoſed them; and now the King thinking it his time to ſet upon them, gave them Battel at <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath</hi> near <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and totally Routed them, ſlaying 2000, and taking their Ringleaders with many others Priſoners, who were moſt of them Executed: <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Blackſmith glorying in his way to Execution, that for this deed he ſhould be Recorded in Hiſtory; and indeed he miſſed not of his Expectation.</p>
                  <p>The King being now at leaſure to revenge the wrongs the <hi>Scots</hi> had done in the North, ordered the Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> and <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> to raiſe ſuch Forces as they could, and oppoſe their Rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges till he ſent a greater Strength; but theſe two active Men raiſed ſuch a Power, that the <hi>Scots</hi> upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach immediatly retired into their own Country, and were followed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who retaliated in a fearful manner the injuries done within the <hi>Engliſh Pale,</hi> winning and razing many ſtrong Caſtles, Towns, and Fortreſſes; and though the <hi>Scots</hi> King made ſhew he would give Battel, and Challenged the Field, yet in the Night he Decamped and gave his Army free leave to diſperſe it ſelf; ſo that for ſeven Days the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hunted them in Woods and Mountaines, tho' to little purpoſe; for Winter approaching, the Barrenneſs of the Country conſtrained them to return to <hi>Berwick,</hi> to receive King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Orders. But in the mean while <hi>Peter Hyalus,</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> arrived to Mediate a Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet it came to no more than a Truce for
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:61951:342"/> certain Years, on condition the <hi>Scots</hi> King Baniſhed <hi>Perkin,</hi> and all his Adherents out of his Dominions; and about the ſame time the <hi>French</hi> King ſent to Ratify the Peace that had been concluded between King <hi>Henry</hi> and himſelf, which was Accorded; and <hi>Maximillian</hi> perceiving his Country of <hi>Flanders, &amp;c.</hi> much Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for want of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, with many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties procured it to be Reſtored; and our Merchants coming to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> were received by the Inhabitants with ſolemn Proceſſions, Feaſtings, and all demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy imaginable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> by means of the Truce being Expell'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sailed away with four Ships and Landed in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where the ordinary ſort of People received him with Joy and loud Acclamations, raiſing in a ſhort time a great Multitude to Aid him; tho' for Rebellion they had ſeverely ſmarted but a little before; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with great Multitudes he Beſieged the City of <hi>Exceter,</hi> but the Citizens ſtoutly withſtood them in their Attempts to Scale the Wales, ſlaying very many of them. Whereupon they put Fire to the Gates and Burnt them, but could not Enter by reaſon the Beſieged Countermured them with Fire, and kept it with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſupplies of Fuel, ſo fierce that they had time to raiſe Bulwarks and Ramparts. Then the Rebells by Threats and fair Promiſes endeavoured to oblige them to ſubmit; but theſe proved fruitleſs, for being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the King, who promiſed to come to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief very ſpeedily, with an Army, they ſtoutly refuſed all Conditions of Surrender; and upon the Kings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Siege was raiſed, the Rebells Marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> where they laid Siege to <hi>Taunton Dean;</hi> but being cloſe followed, <hi>Perkin</hi> with 60 Horſe fled from the reſt, and finding the Sea-ports ſtopped, he took Sanctuary in <hi>Beauley Abby</hi> near <hi>Southampton;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtering
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:61951:342"/> his own, and the Names of ſome few of his Companions, who had got thither with him; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his Train being Taken by the King's Light-Horſe-Men, who cloſely Purſued: And the Multitude Submitting, and throwing down their Arms, were received into the Kings Protection, unleſs ſome of the Chief, who being Taken were Executed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places.</p>
                  <p>The King after this coming to <hi>Exeter,</hi> highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Citizens for their Loyalty and Courage, rewarding the Meaner ſort with Money, and thoſe of Note with Knighthood and profitable Places of Truſt giving his own Sword to the Mayor, with a Priviledge that it ſhould always be born before him. And the Sanctuary where <hi>Perkin</hi> was, being incompaſſed with Armed Men, and he perceiving their orders were to take him thence by force, he Surrendered himſelf to the Abbor of <hi>Sheen,</hi> Intreating him to procure the Kings Pardon for him; whereupon he was brought to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and publickly declared his mean Birth and Parrentage, and that he had been perſwaded to this Undertaking chiefly by the Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;</hi> whereupon with a Paper of all the Intreague Pinned on his Back, he was ſet upon a Scaffold, faſtned in a pair of Stocks a whole Day before the Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the following day in like manner at <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs,</hi> and then made a cloſe Priſoner in the Tower, where Bribing the Keepers, and practicing to Eſcape into <hi>Flanders,</hi> tho' he had been Pardoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was for this Executed at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> and the King laying hold on this to rid him of the fears he had of the True Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s being one day advanced to the Throne, was not wanting of Evidence who Accuſed him to have attempted his Eſcape with <hi>Perkin,</hi> and tho' having been kept in Priſon from his Infancy, ſo that he
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:61951:343"/> knew not a Gooſe from a Hen, that poor Prince was wrongfully Condemned of High Treaſon, and Behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> whoſe Innocent Blood fixed a ſtain on King <hi>Henry</hi> to all Poſterity; his Death being rather looked on as a State-Policy, than any ways Juſt; and that in this he had done that Crime, for which he had ſo vehemently accuſed <hi>Richard</hi> the Third; only with this difference, That he made his Courts of Juſtice Guilty of a Crime not inferiour to what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had impoſed on private Aſſaſſins: For this <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was Son to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> ſecond Brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and the laſt of the Male Line of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> who had ſway'd the Scepter from <hi>Henry</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> by this Bloodſhed having more firmly Eſtabliſhed his Throne, or at leaſt himſelf, from thoſe fears that he apprehended from mutable Fortune, whilſt this Young Prince Lived, Married <hi>Arthur</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, to the Lady <hi>Catharine,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with great Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. But that Young Prince ſoon after Dying, ſhe was Married to <hi>Henry</hi> his Second Son, who Succeeded: But upon ſome pretended ſcruples, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced; as will appear at large in the Hiſtory of his Reign. And <hi>James</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Scots,</hi> ſuing for the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Daughter, the Match was concluded, tho' the <hi>French King</hi> and others had required her, but could not obtain their Suits; for in this <hi>Henry</hi> wiſely conſidered, That if his Sons Iſſue ſhould fail, it would be a means to unite <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> when if he had Married her to a more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kingdom, this muſt have been Subjected to that, which he concluded would prove very diſhonourable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and the Lady being ſent to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourough,</hi> was there Married with great Solemnity.</p>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:61951:343"/>
                  <p>The King in the latter end of his Reign growing exceeding Covetous, contrived how he might extort Money from his Subjects; and for this, as his chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, he uſed Sir <hi>Richard Empſon</hi> and <hi>Edmund Dudley</hi> two Lawyers, whom he appointed to put the Penal Laws in execution with great Rigor; which they ſpared not to do, to the utmoſt, tho' in the next Reign it coſt them their Lives; nor was the complaints of the oppreſſed People minded, tho' exceeding great and many, from all parts of <hi>England,</hi> which encouraged a whole ſwarm of Locuſts, as under Officers, to pill and pole them in every Shire, which cauſed the King much hatred.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in Right of his Wife, coming to be King of <hi>Spain</hi> was in his Voyage thither driven by a Tempeſt into <hi>Weymouth</hi> Harbour in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> where with his Queen he was Entertained by Sir <hi>Thomas Trenchard,</hi> and after Invited to the King's Court at <hi>Windſor;</hi> where, for the Entertainment he gave him, he procured the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> fled into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to be put into his hands, on condition he ſhould have no violence offered him; and indeed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Kings Reign he was only kept a Priſoner; but in the next loſt his Head. King <hi>Henry</hi> ſoon after falling Sick of a languiſhing Diſeaſe, which was looked on as a Judgment for oppreſſing his Subjects, remitted all offences againſt his Penal Laws, enlarged all Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, except for Treaſon &amp; Murther, reſtored Moneys to thoſe that had been Ruined, relieved the Poor, and did many good Acts. And having Reigned 23 Years and 8 Months, he Dyed, and was Buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the famous Chappel of his own founding, by <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> his Queen, (who Dyed not long before) in the 52d Year of his Age.</p>

For this good Service the Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was Created Duke of <hi>Norfolk, Charles Brandon</hi> Viſcount <hi>Lyſle,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Woolſey</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and after ſome Bickerings with the <hi>French</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> King <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſtricken much in Years, ſued for Peace; and the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, Married the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Second Siſter to King <hi>Henry,</hi> a Young and very Beautiful Lady, at whoſe Wedding and Coronation many brave feats of Chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were performed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who waited on her: But <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th Dying three Months after this Marriage, ſhe returned again for <hi>England,</hi> and with the King's private conſent was Married to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who had a long time been her Lover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Woolſey,</hi> who was a Butchers Son at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to riſe a pace; for Doctor <hi>Bambridge</hi> dying, he was made Arch-Biſhop, (and after, by the Pope, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) of <hi>York,</hi> which puffed him up with ſo much Pride, that he undertook to Rule the King and Kingdom, doing for a time, without controul, what he liſted, placing and diſplacing Officers, and meddling in all Affairs where there was Advantage or Homage to be gained: Eſpecially when made Lord Chancelour, and Counſellour of State; demanding Accounts of the Treaſurers, Captains, and other Officers that had been in the Wars; by which he got much Money out of ſome that were Rich; and thoſe that could not furniſh him, he Puniſhed and Impriſoned; Erecting Courts of his own head, and by ſubtilty got himſelf to be made the Popes Legat; and to Build two Colledges, by the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61951:349"/> Popes permiſſion, ſuppreſſed and ſeized on the Lands &amp; Effects of many Religious Houſes, which gave an inlet to King <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſuppreſſing the reſt ſome time after; who concluded if it were not Sacriledge in the Pope, but he could alow of it at pleaſure, it would be none in him. However, this Cardinal was ſent on ſeveral Honourable Embaſſies, wherein he behaved himſelf ſo Proudly, Naming the King but in the Second place, as <hi>Ego et Rex meus,</hi> I and my King; That Forreigners admired how ſuch Arrogancy could be ſuffered by any Prince in his Subject; but his Fall was ſwifter than his Riſe; ſo that what he chiefly aimed at, (<hi>viz.</hi> to be Elected Pope, in making Intereſt for which promotion at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other Courts, it had coſt <hi>England</hi> vaſt ſums of Money) he never attained to.</p>
                  <p>For King <hi>Henry</hi> growing into a diſlike of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between him and the Lady <hi>Catharine,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe ſhe had been his Brother <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Wife, tho' indeed (as it after appeared) rather by a Divorce to make way for a freſh Beauty, the Cardinals delays and croſſing the Kings haſte in this purpoſe, made him fall into diſgrace, which brought him to his End; as will by and by be manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>The King by Riotous Living at home, and Expences in Forreign Courts, where Ambaſſadors (eſpecially <hi>Woolſey</hi>) were attended with ſuch State that they rather ſeemed the King himſelf, than his Repreſentatives; had now pretty well emptied his Coffers, which put him into ſome diſcontent: But <hi>Woolſey,</hi> both to Enrich the King and himſelf, laid hold of his Melancholy and Wants, as a favourable opportunity, of his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thotity granted out Commiſſions under the Great Seal for Levying a Tax all over <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true value of every Mans Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> Of every Fifty Pound value, and upwards, Four Shillings
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61951:349"/> in the Pound; and for every Pound above Twenty, and under Fifty, two Shillings; and all under Twenty, Twelve Pence in the Pound; and in <hi>London</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed himſelf chief Commiſſioner: And by another Commiſſion the Clergy, without exception, were Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Four Shillings in the Pound for their Livings.</p>
                  <p>This ſeemed ſo grievous to all ſorts of People, ſo great a Tax never having been laid on them before, and this done without Authority of Parliament, that the Meaner ſort grievouſly Curſed the Author and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of their Miſeries; and thoſe more diſcreet, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for theſe Reaſons to have the Commiſſion Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe the Commiſſions were not eſtabliſhed or groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Laws of the Kingdom.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe and many more Reaſons prevailed not, till the King perceived the Peoples diſcontents every where ſo great, that he feared a general Inſurrection; and then he ſent his Letters to countermand the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, diſſembling that he knew any thing of thoſe Commiſſions that had been given out to Levy the Tax; and the Cardinal ſeeing his Project fruſtrated, and fawningly to excuſe himſelf to the People, he certified in all Counties by his Letters, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe he ſaw thoſe Taxes were too grievous for them to bear, he had in compaſſion to them, kneeled to the King,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:61951:350"/> and prevailed with him to Revoke the Commiſſions: Yet few believed him, for the greater part were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that it was done againſt his mind, and that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fretted at the diſappointment, it being the firſt rub that had checked his Arbitrary Will. When to ſpend his Gaul on ſome body, and eaſe his Anger, he after he had given the King <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and all his fine Buildings there, in exchange for his Palace of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> prevailed to have the ordering the King's Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould; which was no ſooner granted, but he turned out all worthy deſerving Perſons, and Sold their Places and Offices to ſuch as would be more obedient to him.</p>
                  <p>About this time the <hi>French King</hi> requeſted the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daughter, to be given in Marriage to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his Son; but whilſt this Match was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, and by ſome liked, and by others diſapproved, a Scruple was caſt in the way (as moſt thought upon the ſecret intimation of <hi>Woolſey,</hi> in deſpight to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, becauſe by Strength he had not made him Pope, when by his Money and Policy he had failed to obtain it) by the Preſident of <hi>Paris,</hi> who Queſtioned <hi>Whether the Lady was Legitimate, as Born in Lawful Matrimony, ſeeing ſhe was Begotten on the Body of the Lady</hi> Catharine, <hi>who had been his Brother</hi> Arthur<hi>'s Wife.</hi> This made the Lawfulneſs of the King's Marriage be called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and himſelf ſo averſe to it, that (by the Counſel of Doctor <hi>Longland</hi> his Confeſſor, who told him he had Lived Inceſtuouſly almoſt twenty Years) he forſook the Queen's Bed, to her great grief and diſcontent: And however, tho' upon this pretence the Match was broken off, yet <hi>Woolſey</hi> was ſent over, who concluded a Peace with the <hi>French King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Legality of the King's Marriage, after this, coming hotly to be Diſputed, to determine which, the Pope ſent <hi>Campeius</hi> with a power Legantine, which he

And the next Term the King cauſed his Attourney General to prefer an Indictment againſt him, on the Statute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> on ſeveral Articles, which being found by the Grand Jury, he Confeſſed all the material points by his Attourney: And all his Promotions, except the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>York</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> were taken from him; and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> was made Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour.

                  </p>
                  <p>A Parliament being Aſſembled, the Commons made great complaints againſt the Clergy, exhibiting divers Articles relating to their <hi>Pride, Luxurious way of Living, Trading as Husbandmen, and Merchants, to the Injury of thoſe brought up to it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This was ſtrongly oppoſed by Dr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who Reflecting on the Commons (by ſaying, <hi>Now with our Commons is nothing but Down with the Church; and all this is for lack of Faith only</hi>) they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it to the King, by Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> their Speaker, and others; but the Biſhop excuſing himſelf by putting another Interpretation on the meaning of his Words, they were contented with the King's ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehending him; and then they proceeded to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle againſt <hi>Woolſey</hi> under ſeveral Heads, Charging him

However the King, by reaſon of his former Favour, permitted him to retire to the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> and there continue privately till further orders. But he tampering with the Pope, and being encouraged by his Letters to oppoſe the King, and force him if he would not otherways comply, to reſtore him to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or elſe by virtue of a Bull to Curſe him, and take the power of the Clergy Government into his own hands, as the Popes Vice Roy; whilſt he was in his way to <hi>York,</hi> and preparing for his Inſtallment, he was Arreſted by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> whereupon he ſhewed the Meanneſs of his Spirit and Birth, as all Cruel, Proud Upſtarts uſually do, when they fall into any affliction, though in their proſperity they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of others Calamities, but rather labour to promote than decreaſe them: For however upon his firſt being ſeized, thinking to terrify the Earl, who never bore any good-will towards him, he told him <hi>He was a Member of the Colledge of Cardinals at</hi> Rome, <hi>and that neither the King, nor any other Temporal Prince, could or ought to Intermeddle with him for any Cauſe or Matter whatſoever.</hi> But this nothing availing, he fell into Tremblings and Frights, and when the Kings Letter was produced to give him ſome beams of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he might not altogether deſpair of Mercy and Favour, with a ſordid Meanneſs of Spirit, he fell on his knees in a dirty place, and kiſſed it, ſhedding Tears for Joy; when in the height of his State and Pride, he had accounted the King as his Pupil, more than his Soveraign: For indeed his firſt Station in the World
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61951:353"/> was an ordinary <hi>Pedagogue,</hi> or <hi>Schoolmaſter.</hi> But at the ſight of Sir <hi>William Kingſtone,</hi> Conſtable of the Tower, with a Guard of Yeomen, to convey him Priſoner thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his fears ſo encreaſed, that he fell Sick at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Abby, and taking a ſtrong Confection, which ſome ſuppoſe he did purpoſely to Poiſon himſelf, he breathed his laſt; ſaying a little before he Dyed, <hi>If he had Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his God ſo faithfully as he had done his King, he would not at that time have caſt him off.</hi> And thus fell that Pageant of ſuddain Greatneſs, unpitied by all, Inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome by his Death, tho' in his Life-time he had Ruined many more.

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> by this time having gotten it under the Seals of moſt of the Univerſities in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> That his Marriage was Unlawful, procured a Divorce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes Diſpenſation; and ſoon after he Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anna Bullen,</hi> whom he had Created Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Lady, Daughter to the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi>

Whereupon <hi>Northumberland</hi> laying hold on the opportunity, Charged him with an Intention to have Murthered ſome of the Kings Privy Counſellors, and afterwards produced Witneſſes to aver, he had before come with Armed Men to attempt his Life, but that his Courage failed him; and one of his followers, when he returned, demanding if he had done it, and he ſaying No, replyed, then you are undone: Upon this, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Favorites, he was ſent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:61951:367"/> whoſe Right was before her Daughter.

                  <p>Upon this account divers Marriages were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the Nuptials celebrated, <hi>viz.</hi> The Pious and Virtuous Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> Eldeſt Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in a fatal hour was Married to the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> Fourth Son to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> for all his other Sons were Matched before: <hi>Catharine,</hi> another Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s, was Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Earl of <hi>Pembrooks</hi> eldeſt Son; and <hi>Mary</hi> a third Daughter, ſome what deformed, to <hi>Caies,</hi> the Kings Maſter Porter; and the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> gave <hi>Catharine,</hi> his youngeſt Daughter, to the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Huntington.</hi>

                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, the Kings Sickneſs much encreaſed; for <hi>Northumberland</hi> had diſplaced his Phyſitians, and put him into the hands of a Woman to cure, who it is thought haſtened him to his Grave; for no ſooner had they procured him by his Will, which was read in the hearing of the <hi>Counſelors, Judges,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>This was no ſooner known by the Lords at <hi>London,</hi> but the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was immediately Proclaimed Queen: Yet ſhe received the <hi>Regalia</hi> unwillingly, not without ſome Sighs and Tears, which Preſaged the Misfortune ſhe was violently thruſt upon; ſo that it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all preſent, it was much againſt her will ſhe aſcended this height of Honour; and indeed as ſhe paſſed through the City, tho' there were crouds of Gazers, yet very few Shouts or Acclamations of Joy, as in ſuch caſes are uſual, were heard: Which gave courage to the contrary Party, who heitherto had kept ſilence; but now began to grow bold in their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the Council ſitting, a Letter was preſented from the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> wherein ſhe commanded the Lords to repair to her, acknowledg her the Right Heir to the Crown, and their Lawful Princeſs, and do their Duties and Services, as became Loyal Subjects. Many

However he Marched ſlowly towards <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in the mean while the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Party greatly encreaſed by the coming over of the Earls of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Cornwallis,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Jernington,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Drury,</hi> Sir <hi>John Williams,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Waldgrave,</hi> and others; and ſoon after Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Haſtings,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with 4000 Foot he had Raiſed by his order; for which he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter created Earl of <hi>Lowborough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, ſix Ships with Stores, Ammunition and Proviſion, which the Duke had cauſed to Watch the Coaſt, and Intercept <hi>Mary,</hi> if ſhe ſhould fly, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her hands, as driven by ſtreſs of Weather into <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> when a great part of her Forces were there, by whom they were ſeized. And Sir <hi>Henry Jerningham</hi> conſigned them to her uſe. Having by this means got a Traine of Artillery, ſhe Marched towards <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> Snow-Ball like, gathering as ſhe proceeded; which made the Duke ſend to the Lords at <hi>London</hi> to
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:61951:376"/> ſupply him with more Forces, for on the Muſter he found many were Deſerted, and till their coming he reſolved to ſtay at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> but they hearing how things went, and finding the People unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, began more to conſult their own ſafety, than any other matter; and leaving the <hi>Tower,</hi> they met at <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s <hi>Caſtle;</hi> and there contrary to their ſollemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they conſulted to Depoſe the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> whom they had ſo lately advanced to the Throne; and the Earl of <hi>Arrundel</hi> being Spokeſman, boldly declared the neceſſity of it, enveighing bitterly againſt the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> recounting many things that have been already mentioned of him, urging the unlawfulneſs of what they had done; and that there was no better Cure of Error, than mature and timely Repentance; and therefore he beſought them all preſent, with one Heart and Mind to endeavour to the utmoſt that <hi>Mary</hi> (the undoubted Lawful Heir of the Crown) might preſently be Proclaimed Queen. See in this the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Converſion Fear can work in Mens minds, for untill he perceived the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> Powerful, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come in by Force, except <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he was the moſt violent againſt her.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Advice, and ſome other Debates, it was agreed the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be Proclaimed Queen; for the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> ſaying he heartily agreed with <hi>Arrundel,</hi> and laying his Hand on his Sword, Swore <hi>He would try it with any one that ſhould preſume to maintain the contrary,</hi> moſt became willing, and the reſt were carried away in the ſtream of Power; and ſo ſending for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, they went to <hi>Cheap Croſs,</hi> and there, to the great wonderment of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Proclaimed <hi>Mary</hi> Queen; and paſſing to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was Sung, ſending ſome to take poſſeſſion of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and others to Summon the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
                     <pb n="521" facs="tcp:61951:376"/> laying all Excuſes aſide, to appear at the Council-Board.</p>
                  <p>The Duke perceiving Ruin threatned him and his Family, by laying too great a ſtreſs on Treacherous Friends, and drawn into a Snare by <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s ſubtilty, he yet concluded to uſe ſuch means as he hoped might avert the coming Storm; wherefore upon this notice he went to his Daughters Chamber of State, cauſing her to lay aſide her Princely Ornaments, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing her not to take it grievouſly that ſhe was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, and live a Private Life: To which, with a compoſed Countenance, ſhe Reply'd, <hi>Moſt loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I with more Joy and Gladneſs entertain the Meſſage you now bring me, than that, when ſore againſt my will, you placed me in the Throne. I then diſpleaſed my ſelf that I might ſhew my Obedience to you and my Mother. I believe I have greatly Offended in what I have done, but now I willingly Obey you, and am well contented to renounce the Crown and to confeſs my fault; if at laſt ſo great an offence may be wiped away by an acknowledgment of my Error.</hi> After this, ſhe retired to her Cloſet, and the Ladies that waited on her, were diſcharged from that Office, and deſired to retire to their reſpective Habitations; which they did, tho' not without Tears, to ſee Innocence precipitated into ſo great a misfortune as was likely to follow.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> after this, went to the Council of Lords, and ſubſcribed the laſt Proclamation; and thereupon the Earl of <hi>Arrundel</hi> and divers others, poſted to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (for ſo now I muſt ſtile her) with a great Train, and procured their Pardons. The Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſomwhat late, hearing of theſe Proceedings, in much perturbation of mind, ſhewed his meanneſs of Spirit, in running into the Street at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and Proclaiming Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> throwing up his Cap, and capering amongſt the croud, as if he had done
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:61951:377"/> it with all the ſincerity and alacrity imaginable; when every body knew Fear, and hope of Pardon, compelled him to it. Yet a few days after, he and divers others, whilſt they were preparing for Flight, as doubting the worſt, were Arreſted by the Lord <hi>Arrundel,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the Army he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Disbanded, and ordered on pain of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Rebells to repair immediatly to their ſeveral Houſes; and the Virtuous Lady <hi>Jane</hi> (after ten Days Acting the Queen as on a Stage) by ſpecial order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the <hi>Tower,</hi> The Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> was Impriſoned, and divers others of Note, who they ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted were any way concerned in this buſineſs; and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon her Siſters coming towards <hi>London,</hi> went to meet her Siſter, and Congratulated her Succeſs, highly commending her for ſo undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuing her Right to the Crown; and upon her enterance into <hi>London</hi> ſhe cauſed the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Edward Courtney,</hi> Son to the Marqueſs of <hi>Exceter</hi> Beheaded in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, to be ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as alſo <hi>Stephen Gardener,</hi> and all the <hi>Romiſh Clergy</hi> were releaſed from their confinement, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Conſtituting <hi>Gardener</hi> Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> reſtoring the deprived Popiſh Biſhops to their Offices and Dignities, outing thoſe of the Reformed Religion that had by King <hi>Edward</hi> been preferred to thoſe Biſhopricks, as <hi>London, Wincheſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>He told him, <hi>The Lady</hi> Mary <hi>his Eldeſt Siſter was a profeſſed Roman Catholick, and if ſhe came to the Crown, would deſtroy the Reformed Religion, and therefore it was the Duty of a good and Religious Prince to ſet light by all natural tyes and reſpects of Blood, in regard of the Glory of God and the benefit of his Subjects Salvation: That ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance awaited thoſe that ſhould do otherwiſe; for when this Life was ended, they muſt appear before Gods high Tribunal, there to give an Account of all their Actions, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Reward of Eternal Life, or the Doom of Eternal Death.</hi> But this was then to ſerve his ends. And I pray God too many in our days do not make Religion a pretence to advantage themſelves. One thing more is remarkable in this great Mans fall, of which it is ſaid he took exceeding notice, <hi>viz.</hi> As he paſſed to the <hi>Tower</hi> when firſt committed, a Woman out of a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony ſhook a bloody Handkerchief, ſaying, <hi>Look you here's the Blood of a right Noble Man and the Kings <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle, which was ſhed through your wicked Treachery; and now
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:61951:379"/> cryeth for Revenge againſt you.</hi> But his profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion ſaved not his Life; tho' it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Dr. <hi>Heath</hi> his Confeſſor, had on this account put him in great hopes of Pardon, which was conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured from the unwillingneſs that appeared in him to ſubmit to the ſtroak: Near the ſame time Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> two of the Dukes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, were Beheaded for accompanying him to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which by the Judges was conſtrued Rebellion, and conſequently Treaſon againſt the Queen: And divers Proteſtant Biſhops, as Dr. <hi>Hooper</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Coverdale</hi> of <hi>Exceter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Farrar</hi> of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, were deprived of their Livings, who would not comply with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Soon after theſe Proceedings, the Lords <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> two Sons to the Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Virtuous Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> Wife to the latter, were Try'd and found Guilty of High Treaſon, and Condemned: Arch Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Impriſoned; but nothing of Treaſon appearing againſt him, he was at that time Releaſed, but afterwards Condemned to the Flames for Hereſy, as in the Martyrology annexed to this Reign, will appear; wherefore by the way, take notice that to avoid breaking the thred of Hiſtory, by ſo many occaſions as muſt in his, and other caſes of that nature, occur; for the better underſtanding of the Reader, I ſhall omit them here, to place them by themſelves.

Yet many diſliked it, as fearing when the Queen was Married, her Husband would do as he pleaſed, by eaſily prevailing on her to have the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Offices, Treaſure, and Armies; and under this pretence Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> raiſed a Rebellion in <hi>Kent,</hi> and attempted to enter the City of <hi>London;</hi> but being forcibly reſiſted at <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> fetching a compaſs

                  <p>This Rebellion (in which her Father had under-hand ſided) haſtned the Death of the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> and her Husband; for Dr. <hi>Fecknam</hi> being ſent to her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to the Romiſh Religion; but ſhe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unmovable, the Warrant was ſigned for her Execution; and the Lord <hi>Guilford</hi> being firſt Beheaded, ſhe unconcern'd beheld his Body brought all Bloody into the <hi>Tower,</hi> expoſed to her view, the more to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify her, and with a ſettled Conſtancy of Mind (tho' ſhe did not much exceed Sixteen Years) mounted the Scaffold, and Embracing the Divine that had attended her, <hi>Deſired God to reward him for his Pious endeavours, in Counſelling and Adviſing her about the weighty Concern of an Immortal State;</hi> and then turning to the by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with a compoſed Countenance, Lovely in Sorrow, ſhe thus ſpoke her Mind.</p>

                  <p>A while after, the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> being Impriſoned, was Condemned for having a hand in <hi>Wiat</hi>'s Rebellion, and attempting to raiſe others, as it was Charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him on his Tryal; tho' on very ſlender proof.

                  <p>Divers taken in <hi>Wiat</hi>'s Rebellion being about this time Executed, and ſome Pardoned, <hi>Wiat</hi> (in hopes of Life) was wrought on to Accuſe the Marqueſs of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceter,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Queens Siſter; but being nevertheleſs brought to Execution, he heartily begged both their pardons with Tears, excuſing them from having any hand in his Rebellion; for which, tho' he dyed by the Ax, his Body was Quartered, and ſet upon ſeveral Gates in the City; and within a while, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> was Beheaded: For this Queen ſeemed to have learned her Fathers way, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſpare none that ſtood in her

                  <p>The Queen calling a Parliament, propounded to the Houſes her Intended Marriage, and the deſire ſhe had of reſtoring the Popes Supremacy; but to the latter at this time ſhe could not get their Conſents, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles imagining they muſt reſtore the Church-Lands, if the Pope once came to aſſume a power over the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical State. But the former, upon ſeveral advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous additional Articles, they allowed; and King <hi>Philip</hi> with a great Train of the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Nations, came to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> where the Queen ſtay'd to receive him; and on St. <hi>James</hi>'s Day they were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, with great pomp and ſolemnity, and their Stiles pronounced in Latin, French, and Engliſh: Whereupon <hi>John Figuora,</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſador, reſigned to them (in his Maſters name) the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and the rejoycing being a little over, they came to <hi>London;</hi> where they were received in much ſplendor; and going to <hi>Windſor,</hi> the King was Inſtalled Knight of the Garter, and Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> ſent for over to ſettle the affairs of the Church, being appointed the Popes Legate; and in Parliament his Attainder was taken off, and he reſtored to all his Honours and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and making a moving Oration to both Houſes, won upon them to be Abſolved by him, as in Form he did after the whole Kingdom; and in the end procured Popery to be reſtored; but not the Lands of the Church: For tho' they ſet light by Religion, thoſe were too ſweet morſels to be parted with.</p>
                  <p>The Queen after this laboured to have King <hi>Philip</hi> Crowned; but the Parliament refuſed their conſent; and ſoon after that, ſhe fancied herſelf to be with Child; and by her Error led many to believe it, ſo that the Infant was Pray'd for. Some in the Pulpets under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to deſcribe its featurs when it ſhould be born,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:61951:382"/> others to direct how it ſhould be brought up; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cradles, Rockers, Nurſes, and ſuch like, were provided, and at laſt it was ſpread abroad with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rumour, ſhe was Delivered of a Prince; then he was deſcribed again in the Pulpits, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at <hi>Antwerp</hi> fired their Guns, and made great Rejoycing; but at length it was diſcover'd the Queen had never been with Child.

                  <p>Know then, That when the Purity of the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> was Clouded, and almoſt Obſcured by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Traditions, Errors, and Superſtitions, to make Godlineſs in the Litteral worldly ſenſe, a Gain, by leading People into Ignorance and blind Devotion in keeping the Word of God from their Knowledge, and in its ſtead, impoſing the Doctrine of Men, not agreeable with it, God in his great Mercy was pleaſed to raiſe up ſuch Inſtruments, as laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle that Light, wicked and deſigning <hi>Rome</hi> had near extinguiſhed; who for the ſake of Gods Holy Truth, expoſed themſelves to the fury of the Adverſary; and as in other Nations there were many, ſo in <hi>England</hi> faithful Witneſſes were not wanting, very early to lay down their Lives. I ſhall not look back ſo far as the <hi>Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> under the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> for tho' they were very grievous, yet more Cruel enſued under the Tyranny of that which calles it ſelf Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> For after <hi>John Wickliff, William Wickham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and many other Learned Men, had <hi>Lighted the Candle,</hi> as I may term it, and opened the Eyes of many in this and the Neighboring Nations, to diſcern Truth from Falſhood (and of this we have juſt cauſe to Glory, ſince the Reformation in all Churches was grounded on it) True Religion ſoon raiſed her Head; and tho' Cruel Adverſaries made her Proſelites few for a time, their Conſtancy and Zeal was very great.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1380 <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter Bolton</hi> and <hi>John Aſherly</hi> were ſeverly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; and ſoon after <hi>Walter Bruce, John Aſhton, John Pateſcul,</hi> and divers more, ſome of which are mentioned in the Hiſtory; but as yet it began not to grow up to Flames, but by degrees it did; for <hi>William Swinderly</hi> was Burnt in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> alſo <hi>William Thorp,</hi> and divers others, Stigmatized, Baniſhed, Whipped, and Starved in Goals; the Popes in whoſe time they Lived, Inciting and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging their Clergy here, to purſue them with all Violence and utmoſt Rigor.

However, their Mallice extended to his dead Body, for it was committed to the Flames; and about this time <hi>John Stile, John Brown</hi> and <hi>Thomas Man,</hi> were Burnt in <hi>Smithfield; Robert Couſens</hi> at <hi>Buckingham, Chriſtopher Shoomaker</hi> at <hi>Newbury, Robert</hi> and <hi>Richard Bartlet</hi> and <hi>John Scrivener</hi> likewiſe ſuffer'd the Flames after all ways had been in vain uſed to make them Renounce their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and thinking to terrify the latter, his Children were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſet Fire to the pile that burnt him.</p>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:61951:386"/> being burnt, he cherfully rubbed it with his Right Hand, ſo that it fell into the Fire; and ſo in Prayers, without moving his Body, he cherfully ended his days in a bed of flames.</p>
                  <p>Some that were Impriſoned they fed with <hi>Sawduſt,</hi> ſome were kept continually in the Stocks with great Waights on their Leggs, ſome with Manacles and bars of Iron fixed about their Necks, and many Rack'd till they were Lamed and Diſtorted in Body. <hi>James Bainham, John Tewsbury, Valentine Sheaf,</hi> and his Wife, <hi>John Bent,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trapnel</hi> ſuffered the Flames; three Perſons were Hanged in Chains, and Starved to Death, for burning a Wooden Image called the <hi>Rood,</hi> at <hi>Dover</hi> Court; <hi>Andrew Honor, John Frith, Thomas Bennet, John Lambert, William Tindal, William Leighton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> a Lawyer, ſuffered the Flames, accuſed for <hi>Lutherans;</hi> for ſo now they termed the Profeſſors of the Goſpel Truths.

And ſo on King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's coming to the Crown, a happy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation enſued; but whether God was angry with us for not making a right uſe of his Favours and Indulgence ſo mercifully extended towards us, or intended to try the Faith, Conſtancy, and Patience of thoſe he deſigned for Veſſels of Honour, I determine not; but that Good Prince being taken to a better Life after a ſhort Reign, <hi>Mary</hi> his Eldeſt Siſter Succeeding him, ſet open again the flood-gates of Perſecution, by reſtoring the Popes Supremacy, and by ſevere Lawes made by a Popiſh Parliament, ſtrictly Prohibiting the excerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion; for ſo now it was called, from ſome Cities and Provinces in <hi>Germany,</hi> Proteſting againſt the Romiſh Errors and Superſtitions; yet ſo mightily were the Profeſſors of it ſtrengthened by the Divine aſſiſtance, that neither Flames nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tortures, could bring about her purpoſes.

                  <p>The chief Points to be Diſputed on was about the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper;</hi> and tho' they were ſhut up in Priſons, had no Books, nor Friends to Conferr with, and a ſhort warning; yet on their ſeveral Days, notwithſtanding the Noiſe, Clammour, Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and great Numbers of their Oppoſers, one by one, ſuffering the violence of many at once, without Order, Meaſure, or Modeſty, Confuted their Adverſaries to that degree, with found Reaſons,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:61951:387"/> and Arguments from Scripture, Fathers, and the Uſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, That being non pluſſed, all they in a Rage could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort was, <hi>viz. You have the Word, and we have the Sword; ſee which is likelieſt to prevail.</hi> And indeed the Diſputation finiſhed, they paſſed Sentence of Death upon thoſe venerable Prelates, That they ſhould be Burnt as Hereticks; which Sentence they received with great Alacrity and Conſtancy of Mind; <hi>Lattimer</hi> expreſſing much Joy that the pleaſure of God was ſuch, that being near Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years of Age, he ſhould have ſo happy a Period as Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſo they were remanded to Priſon to expect it at the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Enemies; and indeed their Execution was delay'd a conſiderable time, in hopes they would have Recanted; but at length <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Lattimer</hi> were brought to the <hi>Town Ditch</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and bound to the Stake, Exhorting the People to a conſtant perſeverance in the True Religion, and recommending their Souls into the hands of Almighty God, Sung even in the Flames, and ſo made an exchange of Earth for Heaven. Whilſt <hi>Cranmer</hi> from his Priſon beheld the diſmal Spectacle, and on his Knees was Praying that their Faith and Conſtancy might not fail in this their Firey Tryal.</p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhops Death was deferred for a time, but the Pope ſending an Expreſs Order to Degrade him, and deliver him over to the Secular Power, to be burnt within Ten Days, committing the Degrading part to <hi>Thurlby</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Ridley;</hi> which done the Aged Prelate was ſo cunningly dealt-with by one Fryar <hi>John,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> That he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over his Humane-Frailty in deſiring Life, upon promiſing a Pardon and Advancement, to Recant his former Tenents, and be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereupon he Subſcribed a Writing to that purpoſe; but Cardinal <hi>

<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61951:387"/> the Popes Authority: And Laſtly, he ſhewed how greatly he had offended God by his Recantation; Profeſſing that his Right Hand, which had raſhly Signed it, ſhould firſt feel the Puniſhment But here he was ſo Interrupted by the Clamours and Railings of the Popiſh Prieſts, that he could be heard but little more; and then being clad in very vile Garments, and hurry'd to the Stake, with many Taunts and bitter Scoffs, when the Fire was lighted, he ſtretched his Right Hand into the Flame, and drew it not back, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs once ſeeming to wipe his Beard, till it droped off; and the Flames raging high, he lift up his Eyes and left and towards Heaven, crying out, <hi>Lord receive my Soul,</hi> and Dyed; not moving his Body whilſt he had Life. And when the whole Frame was conſumed, his Heart was found whole and unſinged by the Fire, in which God himſelf, by a Miracle, gave teſtimony that his Heart was upright with him: And this in any of the Popiſh Faction, would have been ſufficient for a Canonization, and crowded for a place in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender among their Adored Saints. And ſoon after the Bodies of two Learned Men, <hi>viz. Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Paulus Phagius,</hi> were (a long time after they had been buried) dug up, accuſed of Hereſie, and burnt in the Market-place in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s Wife dug up likewiſe, and buried in a Dunghill; ſo it appears their Rage and Mallice extended as well to the Dead, as the Living. And Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> immediatly entered upon the Archbiſhoprick, which before was only ſequeſtered.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe Great Men fell, thoſe of a lower Rank eſcaped not; for Mr. <hi>John Rogers</hi> (who in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, had fled, and aſſociated himſelf with the famous <hi>Tindal,</hi> after his Death returned into <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and was made a Prebend of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> by Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi>) being taken and caſt in Priſon, Sentence of Death paſſed upon him to be burnt, which pain he endured with great Conſtancy and undauntedneſs of Spirit, Exhorting his Wife and Ten Children, who weeping came to take their leave of him, to part with him Joyfully, and Truſt in God, who would be a better Husband and Father to them.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>John Hooper</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> came in for a Crown among the number of theſe Martyrs, and they having Condemned him, he was ſent down to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to be burnt; where (as they ſaid) he had done the greateſt miſchief, in ſowing the Seeds of Hereſie; and there in mallice, becauſe he earneſtly Exhorted the People to be Conſtant in a ſteadfaſt Faith, and not to adheare to the deſtructive Tenents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they Burnt him with Green Wood, ſo that his Leggs and part of his Thighs were conſumed whilſt he continued Praying and Exhorting the People,

Beſides theſe, 7 were Whipped, one to Death; 16 periſhed in Priſons, 12 were Buried in Dunghills, and many lay Condemned in Expectation of the Firey Tryal, and ſome Hundreds fled beyond the Seas; but the death of this Queen, who gave way to ſo much Cruelty, put an end to the Perſecution, the ſtream of Blood being thereby ſtopped. And before this time, and ſoon after, moſt of the Perſecutors were overtaken by Gods Judgments, and came to Miſerable and Deteſted Ends. Some were Executed for ſeveral heinious Crimes, others wandered beyond the Seas, till they Periſhed; and ſome were Eaten up by Vermin.</p>

                  <p>And the firſt publick Teſtimony ſhe gave of her Princly Diſcretion, and Knowledge in the weighty Affairs of State, was to chuſe a Wiſe and Learned Council, cauſing new Commiſſions and Inſtructions to be ſent to the ſeveral Ambaſſadors in Forreign Courts; and deſired by Sir <hi>Edward Hern,</hi> her Agent, who had reſided in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time at the Court of <hi>Rome, That mutual Good Offices might paſs between her and the Pope in matters that concerned Publick Affairs, ſeeing ſhe had happily Succeeded her Siſter on the Throne:</hi> But the haughty Old Man would not Anſwer but in his uſual Dialect, <hi>viz. That the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>was held in Fee of the See Apoſtolick; That ſhe could not Succeed, being Illegitimate; That he could not contradict the Declarations of</hi> Clement <hi>the Seventh, and</hi> Paul <hi>the Third; That it was a great preſumption to aſſume the Name of Queen, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without his conſent; yet, being deſirous to ſhew a Fatherly Affection, if ſhe would renounce her pretentions to the Crown, and refer herſelf wholly to his free diſpoſition, he would do whatever might be done with the Honour of the Apoſtolick See.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen, who was well aſſured of her Title to the Crown by her Right, and by the Eſtates in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, little expecting ſuch an Anſwer, was very much diſpleaſed, called home her Agent; and from that time reſolved never more to hold any Correſpondency with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But having refuſed the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s offers of Marriage with her, counting the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation he promiſed to procure at the Popes hands Unlawful and Wicked, ſhe ſet her mind to contrive the moſt eaſie and inofenſive ways how to reſtore the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61951:389"/> Proteſtant Religion, conſulting with thoſe of the greateſt underſtanding in Affairs of Church and State: and coming to ſome reſult, ſhe placed in the Courts of Judicature, and Offices of greateſt Truſt, ſuch Perſons as were of that Profeſſion, or well enclined to it: And having wiſely weighed all circumſtances, ſhe made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt the encouragement and growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, by reſtraining the Nobles and others from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Children to be Educated beyond the Seas; and cauſed many Ceremonies in Divine Worſhip, uſed in the former Reign, to be laid aſide. And ſo, after the Funeral of her Siſter, prepared for her Coronation; and was in order to it, conducted (with extraordinary Pomp and Triumph) from the <hi>Tower,</hi> through the <hi>City,</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where ſhe was Inveſted with the Regal Ornaments; and was Crowned by the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> the other Biſhops refuſing to perform that Office, as fearing the Popes diſpleaſure, or rather the fall of the <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> in this Kingdom, to which Alteration if they conſented not, they foreſaw they muſt loſe their Biſhopricks.</p>
                  <p>And now People differing much in Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it was ordered by Proclamation, That none ſhould unreverently ſpeak of the Sacrament; and it was alowed to be received in both kinds; yet a Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was appointed to be held at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> upon theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting, the Parliament Adviſed the Queen to Marry, leaving her entirely therein to her own Choice that Children might be Born to Succeed her. To which the Queen made this reply, <hi>That ſhe was already Wedded, which was, to her Kingdom and People;</hi> and having promiſed to take a Husband, if ſo the good of the State ſhould require it, ſhe diſmiſſed thoſe that were ſent to her by both Houſes, on this Meſſage: And ſoon after came an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to propoſe a Marriage between her and Prince <hi>Ericus</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Son; but after he had been ſumptuouſly Treated, he was diſmiſſed with a modeſt Denial; and tho' the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and others, ſued for her Favour, ſhe only gave them her Eſteem, inſtead of her Love; and put them off with fair words.

                  <p>And now the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> returning into that Kingdom, her Husband being Dead, ſent a Letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> full of kind expreſſions, to deſire that a ſincere Friendſhip might be maintained between them; and the Envoy that brought it, had Commiſſion to deal with the Queen to declare her Heir Apparent to the Kingdom; which was inſinuated as the ſafeſt way to continue Peace between the two Crowns. But the Queen Anſwered, <hi>She would do nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61951:393"/> of her Title, but as to this matter, ſhe would refer it to the Perſonal Conferrence that was to be held ſhortly at</hi> York. But that Interview was broken off by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts contrivance, leaſt it might be a means towards creating the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> an inclination to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; whereupon the Queen, the better to ſtrengthen her Hands, built ſeveral Sail of ſtout Ships, caſt a great many Ordnance, and the Art of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-making in <hi>England,</hi> was firſt by her Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found out; ſo that having a great Fleet always at Sea, ſhe was by Forreigners ſtiled <hi>The Queen of the North Seas,</hi> cauſing the <hi>Militia</hi> readily to be provided with Arms, and frequently Exerciſed. And the <hi>Guiſean</hi> Faction labouring to deſtroy the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant Party</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> conſtrained them for the ſafety of their Lives to fall into a <hi>Civil War.</hi> The Queen aſſiſted the latter, and had <hi>Haverdegrace</hi> and <hi>New Haven</hi> put into her Hands as Cautionary Towns for the reimburſment of her Charges, when things ſhould be ſettled; and to keep them firm to her Intereſt, ſo that they ſhould not make a Peace without her conſent; and hereupon ſhe ſent them 6000 Men under the Command of the Lord <hi>Ambroſe Dudley,</hi> and kept the Seas with a conſiderable Navy.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt matters went thus Abroad, Deſigns were carrying on againſt the Queen at Home; whereupon divers of Note, eſpecially thoſe deſcended of the Blood Royal by the two Daughters of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, were Impriſoned. And ſhe calling a Parliament, an Act paſſed for Aſſurance of the Queens Royal Power and Authority over all Eſtates and Subjects within her Dominions: And further Enacted, That the Oath of Supremacy ſhould be adminiſtered to all Perſons, for the better diſcovery of ſuch as ſided with the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her; which much ſtartled the Papiſts, and made
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:61951:393"/> them quiet for a time. In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> one of the chief Leaders of the <hi>French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> being Overthrown at the Battel of <hi>Derux,</hi> was taken Priſoner; as likewiſe Sir <hi>Nicholas Trockmorton,</hi> who paying his Ranſom was ſet at Liberty. But the Admiral <hi>Chaſtillion</hi> took ſo many Places, as ſtartled the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> inſomuch that they conſented to an Edict of Pacification; whereby the Princes were to be reſtored to the <hi>French</hi> Kings Favour. <hi>Conde,</hi> alured with the hopes of the Lieutenancy of <hi>France,</hi> and a Marriage with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Hugonets</hi> to enjoy the freedom of their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Agreement was ſuddainly made, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not only treacherouſly Abandoned, but they Joyned with the Papiſts to drive them out of the places they held, and ſtraightly Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>New Haven,</hi> which by reaſon of the Plague raged grievouſly in it, they had Surrendered to them.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Greatneſs threatning <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> offering reaſonable Terms, a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the two Crowns, and Ratified upon their delivering Hoſtages to pay the Queen at a ſet time a large Sum of Money; upon which the <hi>French</hi> King was Inveſted with the Order of the Garter: Hereupon the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in a fret prohibited all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and his Subjects, which made the Queen remove the <hi>Wooll-Mart</hi> from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Ems</hi> in <hi>Frizland,</hi> but the <hi>Low Countries</hi> being much <hi>Impoveriſhed</hi> thereby, the Edict was Repealed; and now the Queen made her great Favourite Sir <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Lord <hi>Denbigh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Maſter of the Horſe, and this ſhe ſeemed to do the better to qualify him for a Husband for the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> but it ſwelled him to that Ambition that he ſoon aſpired to make preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to herſelf; and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> ſoon after
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:61951:394"/> Married the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> of the Royal Blood, and of this Marriage was born <hi>James</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and firſt of <hi>England.</hi> This not only diſpleaſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but the greater part of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility, becauſe he was ſcarce 20 Years of Age, and eaſie to be ſway'd any way. However he was ſollemnly Crowned King, but by the contrivance of <hi>Murray</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Baſtard Brother, and others, he ſome time after was Blown-up in his Lodging, and his mangled Body thrown by the force of the Pouder into the Garden.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> meeting again, humbly beſought the Queen to Marry, but ſhe ſtill declined it. Shortly after the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> falling into a Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, Recommended her Son to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> yet Recovering, Earl <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> ſuſpected to be one with <hi>Murray</hi> in deſtroying <hi>Darnley,</hi> was forced to fly the Kingdom, and <hi>Murray</hi> raiſed a Party againſt the Queen to Depoſe her; when after ſome conteſting, being over-powered, ſhe fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> and craved Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Protection; but by the Advice of ſome Counſelours bribed by <hi>Murray</hi>'s Faction, in ſtead of allowing her (tho' near in Blood) that favour, ſhe was committed a Priſoner in the cuſtody of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and after 20 Years Confinement, loſt her Head, for holding Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies with the Papiſts, to take away the Life of the Queen.</p>
                  <p>A Paſſage having been diſcovered by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and great Privileges granted to the <hi>Merchants,</hi> The <hi>Czar</hi> or <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> ſent his Ambaſſadors to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with Rich preſents of Furrs, and ſuch other Commodities as his Country yielded; and with them one <hi>Anthony Jenkinſon,</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman,</hi> who had firſt Sailed the <hi>Caſpian Sea;</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

                  <p>In <hi>Ireland, Shan O Neal</hi> fell into Rebellion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and throwing himſelf on the <hi>Hebridians,</hi> he was by them Slain after a ſeeming kind reception, and the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> was ſeized and ſent Priſoner to <hi>England,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>America</hi> with ſome Ships, and contrary to the Capitulation, ſet-upon by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> his Goods ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, and ſome of his Men ſlain, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was ſo exaſperated with the Treachery, that they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which however at that time was not granted, for the Queen having taken the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> who were cruelly <hi>Perſecuted</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, was employed to ſupport them with <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Ammunition;</hi> and in providing for ſuch a fled hither, tho' they had baſely abandoned her at <hi>New Haven.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> General, making fierce War in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> he brought in the Inquiſition to Extirpate the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> There, there happened an Accident that opened a Breach between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain, viz.</hi> Vaſt Sums of <hi>Money</hi> being ſent in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship by <hi>Italian Merchants,</hi> to be Imployed in the Bank in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> for the ruin of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there, thoſe Veſſells were Chaſed upon the <hi>Engliſh Coaſt</hi> by ſome <hi>French Men of War,</hi> and the <hi>Money</hi> being brought on Shoar, the Queen was Adviſed by her Privy Council to ſtay it, and give the <hi>Merchants</hi> Owners Security for the Repaiment of it: Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> cauſed all the Goods and Effects of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> to be ſeized, and the Queen cauſed the

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Alanzon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Younger Brother, now made earneſt Suit to the Queen, and tho'

And the Queen having procured of the Grand Signior a liberty of free Trade in all his Dominions, a Company of <hi>Turkey Merchants</hi> was firſt ſet up. The Pope having beſtowed <hi>Ireland</hi> on the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Rebellion was raiſed there, but the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> being made Deputy, the <hi>Iriſh, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Itallians</hi> were totally routed and put to the Sword.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> a Native of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> adventuring to <hi>America</hi> with a few Ships, Diſcovered divers Coaſts before unknown, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Sail about the World, becauſe he ſhot the Gulf of <hi>Magelan,</hi> returning brought home great Riches; and after being Knighted, he made ſeveral advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Voyages with greater Force, and became ſuch a Terror to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in thoſe parts, that they ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear him Named.

                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> being routed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was after

                  <p>And now the States of <hi>Holland</hi> being brought very Low, ſued to the Queen to take them into Protection, yielding the Soveraignty of the Provinces into her Hands; whereupon taking <hi>Sluice</hi> as a Cautionary Town, ſhe ſent the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with 5000 Foot and 1000 Horſe, to whom, for the Queens uſe, the abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Provinces was committed, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in Writing, and he Inveſted with the Title of Governour and Captain General of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> the United and Confederate Provinces, which he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as alſo the Stile of Excellency; which much offended the Queen, tho' he appeaſed her Anger with Submiſſive Letters: But he Governing with a high Hand, and Impoſing unuſual Cuſtoms on the Merchants, they ſoon grew weary of him; However to create in

Yet ſeveral ſmall places were taken in by the Valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Naſſaw;</hi> but in a Rencounter before <hi>Zutphen,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> received a Mortal Wound of which he Dyed, being for Learning and Valour the Honour of his Time; but the Earl not able to win this place, left it Block'd up, and came to the <hi>Hague;</hi> where he was entertained with complaints of his Conduct, and the ill circomſtances it had brought their State into, which ſo Angered him, that he took away the Juriſdiction of the States Council and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Provinces, and thereupon came for <hi>England</hi> to excuſe his proceedings to the Queen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> having received much damage from <hi>Drake, Hawkins, Cavendiſh, Forbuſher,</hi> and other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Adventurers in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> was now ſtudying how to revenge it, and although there was a ſeeming Treaty carried on, he was making all imaginable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and in his own Ports, of which the <hi>French</hi> King gave the Queen Secret notice; whereupon with all dilligence a Fleet was ſet out, ſome by the Queen, others by Private Perſons, tho' much inferiour in Number and Bigneſs to the Invaders: For beſides the Popes Bleſſing and promiſe of Succeſs, for their Fleet, called the <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 130 Sail, wherein were 19209 Land Soldiers, 8050 Marriners, 2080 Galley-Slaves, and 2630 pieces of Canon, with ſmall Arms and proportionable Stores; beſides they were to be Joyned by Forces the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> was providing in <hi>Flanders.</hi>

But Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> took a great <hi>Carrick,</hi> the <hi>Prize</hi> being valued at 150000<hi>l,</hi> and others did very famous Exploits.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, <hi>Lopez</hi> a Jew, and Phyſitian to the Queen, was hired to Poiſon her; as alſo one <hi>Patrick Cullen,</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> to Stab her; but theſe Deſigns being timely diſcovered, divers Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators were Condemned and Executed. This being found to be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intreague, ſo incenſed the Queen, that ſhe ſent the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and other brave Commanders, to Anoy his Coaſt Towns, who putting in at <hi>Cales,</hi> Took and Sacked that Rich Town, and Burnt a Fleet of Merchants and Men of War, Valued at Twenty Millions of Duckets. And now the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had done many great
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:61951:398"/> and brave things in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and had all along ſtood high in favour with the Queen, was much Diſguſted at the Advancement of ſome Upſtarts, which made them his Enemies, and labour all they could for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſo that being ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Tirowen</hi> who was in Rebellion, they procured him to be Recalled, and laid divers Miſcarriages to his charge; ſo that he was brought to a private Tryal; but upon his Submiſſion, Acquitted by the Queens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and ſet at Liberty. However, being a Man of a high Spirit, he ſo reſented the Affront, That he concluded to remove his Enemies from the Queen by force; whereupon, being Aſſiſted by the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and others, he Fortified his Houſe, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned her Counſellours ſent to him to Adviſe him to ſubmit, and going into <hi>London</hi> thought to have made an Inſurrection in favour of him; but though he was very Popular, they at this time failed him; and at laſt Surrendering himſelf, he with the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> and others was found Guilty of High Treaſon, and the Queen (over-perſwaded) Signed the Warrant for his Death, and he was Beheaded, but <hi>Southampton</hi> Reprieved; Sir <hi>Charles Dorves,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Blunt,</hi> one <hi>Cuff,</hi> and <hi>Merrick,</hi> likewiſe ſuffered Death, on this account. But the Earls Death ſo grieved the Queen, that ſhe laid a bitter Curſe on thoſe that adviſed her to conſent to it; and growing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, ſhe ſoon after retired to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where on the 24th of <hi>March</hi> 1602, ſhe died; when ſhe had Reigned 44 Years, 4 Months, and 7 Days, in the 67th Year of her Age, and was buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being the laſt of the Name of the <hi>Teudors</hi> of the Royal Race.</p>
                  <p>In this Queens Reign a Mare brought forth a Foal with two Heads, and a long Tail growing between
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:61951:399"/> them. A Sow furrowed Piggs with Arms and Hands, fingered as a Child, inſtead of Legs. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures produced Monſtrous Births. A Plague likewiſe happened, whereof Dyed in 8 Months 23660. The <hi>Thames</hi> was ſo hard Frozen that Waines and Carts paſſed it, Markets and divers ſorts of Exerciſes were kept and uſed on it. Great Floods and Tempeſts happened, ſpoiling much Corn, and demoliſhing many Buildings. In <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> a Tempeſt over-threw a Church called <hi>Patrick Burton,</hi> and laid many Villages in Ruins. And many fearful Sights appeared in the Air.</p>

                     <hi>Arabella,</hi> a Branch ſprung from the ſame Stem by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Branch; but it being timely diſcovered, divers were Apprehended, Tryed and Condemn'd; yet only <hi>George Brook,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and two Popiſh Prieſts, ſuffered Death, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> and divers others, being Pardoned; and on the 25th of <hi>July</hi> 1603, the King and <hi>Ann</hi> his Queen were Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the <hi>Marble Chaire</hi> brought out of <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, which fullfilled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy Inſcribed on it, and mentioned in that Kings Reign; and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Son, was made Knight of the Garter, and ſtiled <hi>Prince of Wales;</hi> and Honours were conferred on divers Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The next thing the King proceeded to do, was to decide the Controverſy between the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Party that then ſtiled themſelves <hi>Puritans,</hi> and a Conference to that purpoſe was appointed at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where the King ſo Learnedly Argued, that the former carried the day.

                  <p>Soon after this the King Aſſembled a Parliament, recommending to them the care of the Nation, and a laſting ſettlement of Peace and Tranquility, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſtored the Antient Name of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> cauſing himſelf to be Proclaimed King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And whilſt he and the Parliament happily accorded, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate deſign was carried on to deſtroy them both, for the Popiſh Party being denied the Tolleration they had petitioned for, contrived one of the moſt Stupendious Miſchiefs that ever entered into the Hearts of Men, for their heat of Mallice would not be quenched with the Royal Blood, but that of the Nobility and Gentry, the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61951:400"/> repreſentative body of the whole Kingdom united at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> was to have been ſhattered in pieces and diſmembered by a blaſt of 36 Barrells of Gunpowder, which they had placed in a Cellar under the Parliament Houſe; but it was Diſcovered by a Letter to the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> the Morning before it was to have been put in execution. The principal Conſpirators were <hi>Robert Catesby, Thomas Piercy, Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, John Garnet, Ambroſe Rookwood, John Wright, Francis Freſham,</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Dighby,</hi> and <hi>Guido Faux.</hi> This Latter was to have ſet Fire to the Train, and was taken with his Dark-Lanthorn at the Enterance of the Cellar, on the 5th of <hi>November,</hi> 1605. Which day by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was appointed Annually a Day of Thankſgiving for that memorable Deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Diſcovery, the Conſpirators that eſcaped by flying, were divers of them ſlain by Forces raiſed by the High-Sheriff of <hi>Warwickſhire; Faux</hi> upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before the Council, confeſſed the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying, <hi>God would have had it proſper, but the Devil Diſcovered it;</hi> expreſſing himſelf ſorry that it had not taken effect. <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jeſuite, and others, were Executed on this account, and ſome Lords who were abſent from Parliament, and were ſuſpected to have notice of the Deſign, were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but after ſome confinement were releaſed again, and ſoon after this a rumour was ſpread, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Author, That the King was Stabbed and Slain with an Impoiſoned Knife, as he was Hunting near <hi>Ockingham,</hi> which for a time much troubled the People; nor could their fears be allayed, before a Proclamation came out to ſatisfie them of the contrary; and the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Queens Brother, coming to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> was Magnificently Entertained; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtay'd about a Month, departed highly ſatisfied.</p>

                  <p>The Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that had long continued in bloody Wars, were now United by both their conſents in their Repreſentatives, on a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation advantagious to either Nation, and ſo it has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince continued.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Juliers</hi> about this time dying, the Dukes of <hi>Newburg</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſtrove for that Dutchey, but whilſt they weakly contended, <hi>Spain</hi> (more powerful) reſolved to take it from them both, ſeizing on the City of <hi>Juliers,</hi> the principal place of the Province; which obliged King <hi>James</hi> at the States of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ſupplication, to ſend 4000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Sir <hi>Edward Cecill</hi> and Sir <hi>Hatton Cheek,</hi> by whoſe Valour it was chiefly Reduced. Soon after <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> was Stabbed in his Coach by one <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> paſſing the Ironmongers-ſtreet in <hi>Paris,</hi> for which the Murtherer was pulled to pieces with Burning Pincers, yet could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to tell who ſet him on that wicked Enterprize; and King <hi>James</hi> ſtartled with this untimely Death, put out a Second Proclamation to Baniſh the Jeſuits out of the Kingdom, and all Popiſh Recuſants Ten Miles from the Court.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Sanquire,</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Baron, having his Eye put out by one <hi>Turner,</hi> a Fencing-maſter in <hi>White-Fryars,</hi> in revenge hired two Perſons to Murther him; for which he was Hanged before <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall-Gate,</hi> in the <hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> and Dyed very penitently, tho' great interceſſion was made to ſave him. And the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> (Beheaded in the foregoing Reign) was by the Kings order removed from <hi>Peterborough</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there magnificently Interred; and ſoon after the Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the ſplendour of the Nuptials were Eclipſed by
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:61951:401"/> the Death of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Son; which happened a little before the Weding, not without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of Poiſon, as ſome have it, by the Scent of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed Gloves, others by eating a Bunch of Grapes; but the Diſeaſe affecting moſtly the Brain, it carried him off in Five Days, tho' the Phyſitians gave out he dyed of a Malignant Fever. Whatever his Diſeaſe was, it carried him off on the 6th of <hi>November,</hi> 1610. in the bloſſom of his Youth, he being 18 Years, 8 Months and 17 Days Old: He was a Prince of Extraordinary Wiſdom and Piety much above his Years: Of ſtrength and ability of Body equal to moſt Men, of a Noble and Heroick Diſpoſition; and an hater of Flattery and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers: He had an high Eſteem of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and uſed to ſay, <hi>No other King but his Father would keep ſuch a Man as</hi> Sir Walter <hi>in ſuch a Cage,</hi> meaning the <hi>Tower.</hi> He kept his Court at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, which was much frequented by the moſt ſober of both the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry. Something of the gravity of the Prince's temper, may be known by the following ſtory: Once when the Prince was hunting the Stagg, it chanced that the Stagg being ſpent, croſſed the Road where a Butcher and his Dog were travelling, and the Butchers Dog killed the Stag, which was ſo great, that the Butcher could not carry him off: When the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Company came up, they fell at odds with the Butcher, and endeavoured to incenſe the Prince againſt him; to whom the Prince ſoberly Anſwered, <hi>What if the Butcher's Dog killed the Stagg, what could the Butcher help it?</hi> They Replyed, <hi>If his Father had been ſerved ſo, he would have Sworn at that rate, That no Man could have endured it. Away,</hi> replyed the Prince, <hi>All the Pleaſure in the World is not worth an Oath.</hi> In the time of his Sickneſs, a Perſon whom he lov'd, and who had been the Companion of his Diverſions, coming to ſee him,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61951:401"/> and asking him how he did, the Prince among many other ſober Expreſſions anſwer'd him thus, <hi>Ah Tom! I in vain wiſh for that time I loſt with thee and others, in vain Recreations.</hi> But <hi>England</hi> was not worthy of ſo great a Bleſſing as the Life of this Excellent Prince. For whom, notwithſtanding the Court was not long in Mourning, becauſe of the Nuptials that enſued; and the Elector Palatine having been highly Feaſted and Entertained, departed with his Bride.</p>
                  <p>The King having raiſed one Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> who had been his Page, high in his Favour, creating him Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> ſo that he Acted as it were all in all, and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lady falling in Love with him, and complaining of her Husbands inability in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Nocturnal Duties, the King gave order to the Archbiſhop, that a Divorce might be ſued out, which accordingly was done, and ſhe Married the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> who had been his great Favorite, inveighing much againſt this Marriage, and labouring to diſſwade him from it, becauſe the Lady lay under much ſcandal of Luſt and Incontinency, was by his and her procurement committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there by tampering with Sir <hi>Gervis Ellows</hi> the Lieutenant of that Gariſon, and one <hi>Weſlon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they procured him to be Poiſoned, and the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> who was privy to it, the better to colour the buſineſs, gave out he dyed of the Pox; and that ſtrange noiſom Sores were found on his Body; but this did not long conceal ſo wicked a practice; for it proved their Ruine: <hi>Northampton</hi> dyed ſoon after in a Melancholly diſordered condition; and a little after, the Apothecaries Man, who was hired to give Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> a Gliſter, that had been poiſoned, falling Sick at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> revealed what he knew, as to the Poiſoning; and who was concerned in it. This
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:61951:402"/> News coming over by the means of Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> who had been Ambaſſador in <hi>Holland,</hi> made a great noiſe, and more and more ſuſpicion appearing, the King ſent for the Judges to ſearch narrowly into the Truth of it; Imprecating a Curſe on them and their Poſterity, if they were negligent in it; and the like on himſelf and Poſterity, if he favoured any Guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo that the Viſcount made Earl of <hi>Somerſet</hi> in conſideration of his Marriage with the Lady <hi>Catharine Howard,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Niece to the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> who had been Divorced from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> when he had got his Pardon ſigned, as being charged before with Imbezling the Crown Jewells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had it ſtopped under the Broad Seal; and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſending for him, he went to the King, to complain of the Indignity put upon him, looking on it as a great preſumption in the Man that had done it. But the King, much to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, replied, <hi>Thou muſt go then, for if</hi> Cook <hi>ſends for me, I muſt go too;</hi> and when he parted with him, turning his back, he ſmiling ſaid, <hi>I ſhall never ſee thy Face more;</hi> and the ſame Day the Earl and his Counteſs were made Priſoners, and divers others, as <hi>Weſton,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> a great confident of the Counteſſes, Sir <hi>Jarvis Ellows,</hi> and one <hi>Frankling:</hi> The Four laſt being firſt Tryed, were found Guilty, received Sentence of Death, and were Executed, confeſſing the fact; and ſoon after, the Earl and his Counteſs were Tryed and Condemned; but the King Pardoned them, or rather Reprieved them, giving them only a Leaſe of their Lives for Term of Years, utterly Baniſhing them the Court and his Favour: So that deprived of all Honours, places of Truſt, and Fortunes, they led mean and deſpicable Lives, the dying very miſerably, her Privy Parts Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and he of Diſcontent and Melancholly: So
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:61951:402"/> punctual is God in his Providence, to revenge Innocent Blood on the ſhedders of it, and bring them to ſhame, even in this Life.</p>
                  <p>The fall of this Favourite made way to the riſe of <hi>George Villers,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>George Villers</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> by a ſecond venture; who being a comely Perſon, and his Parts improved by Travel, the King upon his firſt arrival at Court caſt his Eyes on him, made him his Cupbearer at large, and in the End created him Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> growing in a little time as high in favour as the former, doing all with the King as he pleaſed, and continued ſo to do till he was Stabbed by one <hi>Felton</hi> at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> as will appear in the next Reign.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Maſon</hi> being Arraigned, as concerned in the Murther of <hi>Overbury,</hi> had his Tryal ſet aſide, and the Lord Chief Juſtice chequed for venturing to inſinuate, That in this there might be the Diſcovery of more than a Private Perſon; intimating, tho' not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Overbury</hi>'s untimely remove, had ſomething in it of retaliation, as if he had been guilty of the ſame crime againſt Prince <hi>Henry;</hi> and glancing ſome what that the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> had (but how truly I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not) aſſured the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> That the making away of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the King, he had his wings ever after clipped.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> Dyed in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which ſet Mens Tongues and Fears on work, that ſhe followed the ſame fate, but nothing publick appeared in it. She was Daughter to <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> Younger Brother to the King's Father, and <hi>Elizabeth Cavendiſh;</hi> ſhe Married Sir <hi>William Seymour,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Beaucham,</hi> and both at a diſtance being Allyed to the Crown, made the Marriage diſtaſted; but her Husband
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:61951:403"/> eſcaped out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> whether he had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for this conjunction, and fled beyond Sea; and ſhe eſcaping from her Houſe at <hi>Highgate,</hi> to follow him, was intercepted, and Dyed in the place aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>There being a Peace confirmed with all Nations, the King treated with <hi>Spain</hi> about a Marriage between his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> now Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Heir apparent to the Crown, and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> but Ambaſſadors being ſent, many delays were made about difference in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſome other Objections; which the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who Negotiated the matter, perceiving would come to no good effect, the Treaty of Marriage was laid aſide, and overtures at the ſame time made in the Court of <hi>France;</hi> but that, as the former, then ſucceeded not, by the means of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having been ſome Years out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> went thither with a ſplended Retinue; and unluckily about this time the <hi>Book of Sports</hi> was Publiſhed, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the Sabbath Day, for the Recreation of the Younger ſort, after Evening-Service, Dancing about May-Poles, Church-Ales, and ſuch like; which much diſpleaſed ſober People to behold that Sacred Day ſo Prophaned; however, notwithſtanding many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, it continued, and ſome were puniſhed for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, by Writing or otherways.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> making overtures to the King to find out a Rich Mine of Gold-Ore in <hi>Gunia,</hi> by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of Captain <hi>Kentiſh,</hi> once his Servant, he was diſmiſſed with ſome Ships and Men, but <hi>Gondemar,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, getting notice of this deſign, writ to <hi>Spain</hi> about it with ſuch Expedition, that Letters from thence arrived in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to Advertize of his preparations long before he came; ſo that finding almoſt all places Fortified, except St. <hi>Thomes,</hi> they took that, and attempted the River, but in paſſing, found
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:61951:403"/> ſuch oppoſition as conſtrained them to retire, without attchieving their ends; which ſo perplexed <hi>Kentiſh,</hi> that he Shot himſelf in his Cabin; and Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> upon his Return, was ſeized by Sir <hi>Lewis Stukley</hi> his Kinſman; and being brought to <hi>London,</hi> was at the earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and clamour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and many grievous complaints laid to his charge, of Impoſing on the King, and indangering a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> That it would likewiſe break off the Treaty of Marrying again, renewed between the Prince and Infanta of <hi>Spain;</hi> with ſuch aggravations, that the King gave way; he was brought to the King's-Bench Bar at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Records of his former Arraignment were Read, and he demanded, why Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhould not be done upon him, according to the Judgment that had been pronounced againſt him; and he going about to Juſtifie himſelf on the account of his Voyage, was told it was not in queſtion; but that he ſtood there upon his former Judgment, which the King would have Executed upon him; and tho' he urged much againſt it, as the King's Truſt by a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which he look'd upon as a Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was appointed, and he Beheaded in the Old Palace-Yard at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the 60th Year of his Age, which pacified the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for the Loſs ſuſtained by the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Voyage.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> having choſen <hi>Frederick,</hi> Elector <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who Married the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi>'s Daughter, their King, Revolted from the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but being Overthrown by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Imperial General, and all <hi>Bohemia</hi> recovered, upon his return home, he found his <hi>Palatinate</hi> Invaded by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who with other Aides beat him out of it, tho' King <hi>James</hi> ſent about 6000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> to his Aſſiſtance, who did many brave things; but being worſted by great Numbers, the poor remains of them in the concluſion of the War returned home.</p>
                  <p>This made the King call a Parliament to Refund his Treaſure waſted in this War, and on chargable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſeys; but they would not hearken to it before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Grievances were redreſſed; and hereupon divers who had oppreſſed the People, and miſ-ſpent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſure, were Queſtioned and Diſgraced; and among others the Lord Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> for Bribery and Extortion, a thing he had always condemned in others, and for it loſt his Peerage, and the Great Seal, ſpending his days very melancholly afterward, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the empty title of Viſcount St <hi>Albans</hi> to his Grave. And after many contendings between the King and Parliament, they not anſwering his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in giving the Sums required, he Diſſolved it, and put out a Proclamation to reſtrain the peoples Talking to his prejudice, but it little availed; and the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> having been accuſed on that account by one <hi>White</hi> a Papiſt, and the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> by others, they were committed and continued a conſiderable time Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Ambaſſadors found but ſlender ſucceſs in their Negotiations, being delay'd in the Courts of the <hi>Empire, Spain,</hi> and with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
                     <pb n="569" facs="tcp:61951:404"/> which much troubled and vexed him. And there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſtrange Opinions creeping up, the King ſent his Letter to the Arch-Biſhops for Regulating the Miniſtry, and Reforming Abuſes therein; but the Jeſuits and other reſtleſs People, under-hand laboured to Embroil the Factions, and cauſed many diſturbances, which, with other diſſatisfactions from abroad, caſt the King into a Melancholly Temper, eſpecially the ſlights that were put upon the Prince his Son, who went thither to Court in Perſon, attended by <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and others, they endeavouring to pervert him in change of his Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that he was Indiſpoſed and ſo much out of order a long time, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites durſt ſcarcely ſpeak to him. Then hearing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill trifled, his care was to get the Prince home again, leaſt having ſo wealthy a Prize, they ſhould detaine it, and ſent him ſecret notice to return: Whereupon taking leave of the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> and Infanta, and the other Ladies and Grandees, he was attended to the Sea Coaſt; and in his return being in a Barge ſome diſtance from the Ships, by a ſuddain Tempeſt he narrowly eſcaped being caſtaway, for a time neither being able to reach the Ships, or Shoar; but at length he arrived ſafe, to the high ſatisfaction of the King his Father; but this Match after vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Trouble, came to nothing, tho' the Lady had a long time had Tutors to Teach her <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and pleaſed enough ſhe appeared at it; but this was at laſt found only a device to retard the King from medling in the Affairs of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the deſign of this Marriage was his chief aime to reſtore it; whereupon he gave orders to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> his Ambaſſador, poſitively to declare to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> That unleſs that was reſtored to the Elector, the Treaty ſhould proceed no further; and that being refuſed, the Prince
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:61951:405"/> grew cold in his Love, and ſo all was daſhed, upon his thoughts with a Match with the Youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> whom he had ſeen in his paſſage that way to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to whom (after his Fathers death) he was Married.</p>
                  <p>Upon this the King called another Parliament, and miſſing the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> his old Friend, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Lodging, he was found dead in his Bed, without any Wound or ſign of force upon him, which put the King into ſuch grief and conſternation, that he would not go to the Houſe in his Robes; and ſo put them off for ſome Days longer. This Parliament greatly inveighed againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for perſwading the Prince to take ſuch a hazardous Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of the Land, and adviſed the King, ſince ſo many Delays and Tricks had been put upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Nation, to break the Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> proteſting to aſſiſt him for the regaining the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with their Lives and Fortunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They inſiſting on a Religious War, that might be Aiding to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> but the King however ſeemed more to encline to Peace, as appeared by his Letters and Speeches on this occaſion; for fearing that when the War was begun, he ſhould not find wherewithal to maintain it; and therefore thanking them for their proffers and advice, he told them he would conſider better of it; however the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> was utterly diſſolved. This, and ſome forwardneſs for War, ſo fretted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that whether out of Truth and Knowledge (as he pretended) or Malice only, cannot be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſent to the King to let him know, that <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had ſome dangerous Deſign againſt him, tending to his deſtruction; and that it would be the ſafeſt to confine him to ſome Country-Houſe for his Life;
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:61951:405"/> however, tho' it was generally thought to proceed from ſpight, becauſe the Duke ſet himſelf againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, it put the King into ſuch fears, being now grown Old, that all the Duke's proteſtations could not a long time remove them, nor till the Duke's Friends gave upon Oath their knowledge of the Duke's ſincere intentions, and that this was contrived with the Ambaſſador by the Advice of a Jeſuite; and this Parliament, the Earl of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> by <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s procurement, was Queſtioned, but there came no great matter of it; for the Parliament knowing it was done by the Duke's means, upon his Queſtioning for the Money exceſſively ſpent in <hi>Spain,</hi> they had no great mind to back him in it.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, a melancholy Account came from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had five ſeveral Factories, two at <hi>Hitto</hi> and <hi>Lerico,</hi> and two at <hi>Latro</hi> and <hi>Cambello,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Seran;</hi> but the Principal of them was at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> which is the chief Place in all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where <hi>Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves,</hi> and other Spices grow; and from theſe Factories the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſupplied not only <hi>England,</hi> and all <hi>Europe</hi> with Spice; but <hi>Perſia, Japan,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> This made the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Envy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore reſolved to diſpoſſeſs them of the Spice-Trade, which is the beſt in all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all theſe Iſlands were better beloved than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had built a Fortreſs in <hi>Amboyna</hi> for the ſafety of their Trade; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> having two hundred Soldiers on that Iſland, forced this Fortreſs from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and then pretending a Plot between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> for the Recovering of the ſaid Fort from the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> by horrid Torments, burning them under the Soles of their
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:61951:406"/> Feet, and under their Armpits, and pouring Water down their Throats when ſtretched on a Rack, till they were ready to burſt, and by other barbarous ways Maſſacred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, and ſeized upon the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Factories, to the value of Four Hundred Thouſand Pounds; making the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (that had eſcaped their Maſſacre) Slaves, and ſent them into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſlands which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had poſſeſſed themſelves of: This was in the Year 1622; when but three Years before the <hi>Dutch</hi> had concluded a Treaty of Trade between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This News extreamly troubled the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who humbly petitioned the King to demand ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the <hi>States General:</hi> But the King cared not for War; and tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> refuſed to make any ſatisfaction for this Unheard-of Villany, the King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador, <hi>That he never heard nor read of a more Cruel and Impious Act than that of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna; <hi>yet,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I do forgive them, and I hope God will; but my Sons Son ſhall revenge this Blood, and puniſh this horrid Maſſacre.</hi> And ſo left the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the quiet Poſſeſſion of what they had ſo baſely gotten from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without offering to draw his Sword againſt them: Which perhaps occaſion'd his being pictur'd with his Sword in his Scabbard, and two Men pulling at it, but could not get it out.</p>
                  <p>And now the King having permitted the Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> General for the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> to raiſe ſome Forces here, he ſoon after fell ſick of a Tertian Fever; a little before his Death he called for the <hi>Prince,</hi> and rowſed himſelf as deſirous to ſpeak to him; but being too weak, ſunk down in his Bed again, and Dyed at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> on the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1625. when he had Reigned over all <hi>Britain</hi> 22 Years and three Days, being the Twenty Third of his Reign
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61951:406"/> and Fifty Ninth of his Age. He was buried at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was of a Stature inclining to tallneſs, being ſomewhat higher than Ordinary; his Body very well compacted, his Hair of an Aubourn Colour, and of a Pleaſing Countenance; and towards his latter End ſomewhat fat and burly. He had the repute of a Wiſe Prince; but his Reign did not ſhew it: He indeed Writ ſeveral Books againſt the Jeſuite's King-Killing Doctrin, but that ſhewed his Fear more than his Learning; and that he was therein acted by a Principle of Self-Preſervation: For the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth by <hi>Ravilliac</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> were enough to make him afraid of the Jeſuites. He was wholly ruled in all things by his Favourites, to whom he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively bountiful, and thereby ſquandered away the Treaſure of the Nation. At his coming to the Crown he found the Exchequer Rich, but at his Death (which was a great Unhappineſs to his Son) he left it very poor; and well he might, giving ſo profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he did to his Flatterers and Favorites. It is reported of him, That having given Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> Twenty Thouſand Pounds, the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> that he might make the King ſenſible of what he had done, invited him to an Entertainment, and ſo ordered it, that he ſhould paſs to it through a Room wherein he had placed four Tables, and on each Table Five Thouſand Pounds in Silver; when the King came into the Paſſage, he ſtarted, as ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the ſight, (having never before ſeen ſuch a Sum) and asking the Treaſurer the meaning of it? The Treaſurer told the King, <hi>It was the Boon he bad given to Sir</hi> Robert Carr: <hi>Swounds Man,</hi> ſays the King (which was the Oath he uſually ſwore)
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:61951:407"/> 
                     <hi>but Five Thouſand Pounds ſhall ſerve his Turn.</hi> By which means the Lord Treaſurer ſav'd the King Fifteen Thouſand Pounds. This ſhewed how eaſie he was to be impos'd upon, giving his Favourites what they pleas'd to ask, without knowing what it was. His letting the <hi>Dutch</hi> redeem their Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns upon their own terms, and letting them alſo diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of their Factory at <hi>Amboyna</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> by the moſt horrid Maſſacre that any Age had heard of, without any reparation or ſatisfaction for it; however it might Entitle him to be <hi>Rex Pacificus,</hi> it could never be an Argument of his Wiſdom, nor make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a Second <hi>Solomon,</hi> which his Flatterers uſually ſtiled him.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this King's Reign a Plague raged, of which in <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties, in one Year Dyed Thirty Thouſand Five Hundred Seventy Eight Perſons.</p>

                  <p>KING <hi>James</hi> dying at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> on the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1625. The ſame Day his only Surviving Son, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> was Proclaimed King of Great <hi>Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> On the 7th of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing were Celebrated the Funerals of the Deceaſed King; whoſe Body being brought from <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> was Interred in the Abbey at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with great Magnificence, the King himſelf being the chief Mourner. The next thing after the Celebration of the Funeral, was to haſten the coming over of the Queen, <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> Deceaſed, and Siſter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th, then Reigning, who had by the King's Proxy, the Duke of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> been Eſpouſed to him on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> at our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church in <hi>Paris.</hi> Upon <hi>Trinity-Sunday</hi> at Night, ſhe arriv'd at <hi>Dover,</hi> where being met by the King the next Morning, they went from thence to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where they were Married, which the third Day after was Declar'd at <hi>White-Hall</hi> with great Rejoicing.</p>
                  <p>On the 18th of <hi>June</hi> following, the King Summon'd a Parliament to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he urged them for Supplies for the carrying on the War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> upon which the <hi>Commons</hi> gave two Subſidies, and the <hi>Clergy</hi> three. In this Parliament Dr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> the King's Chaplain, was Queſtioned for certain <hi>Tenents,</hi> in his Anſwer to a Book called the <hi>Romiſh Gagger,</hi> and his Defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Intituled, <hi>Apello ad Caeſarem;</hi> and he being brought before the Bar of the Houſe, the <hi>Speaker</hi> declared their Pleaſure, That they would refer his Cenſure till their next Meeting; and in the mean time he ſhould ſtand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Serjeant</hi>'s-Ward, till Two Thouſand Pounds
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:61951:408"/> Bail could be procured for his Appearance next Seſſions. And tho' the King (by Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s means) took him into his Protection, as his Servant, yet his Bond remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Uncancell'd. Divers Laws were Enacted in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and a Bill for <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> paſſed the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> but it Miſcarried in the Lords Houſe, becauſe it was Limitted to a Year; whereas it had been Granted to the King's Predeceſſors during their Lives. And then (the <hi>Plague</hi> greatly encreaſing) the Parliament was Adjourn'd to <hi>Oxford;</hi> where the King again Soliciting for more Money, in order to the ſetting out the <hi>Fleet,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> entred into a Debate about Grievances, and were about drawing up a Remonſtrance to preſent to the King; but it bearing hard upon <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> the King's great Favourite, they were immediately Diſſolved: And ſoon after a Fleet was fitted out, and ſent againſt <hi>Spain;</hi> but having ſtaid Conſidering what to do, till they loſt the Opportunity of Deſtroying the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet in <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which at firſt might have been eaſily done, they Sailed to the <hi>Southern Gape,</hi> in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of meeting their <hi>Plate-Fleet,</hi> but the Contagion having got into the Fleet, they made an Untimely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without doing any thing, but four Dayes before the Fleet came. This unproſperous Succeſs of the Fleet, very much Diſpleaſed the King, who prohibited <hi>Wimbleton</hi> (the General) for ſome time from his Preſence, but he excuſing himſelf, laid a great part of the Miſcarriage on the Stubbornneſs of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> But tho' all were Blam'd, yet none were Puniſh'd for the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Expedition.</p>
                  <p>And now the War growing very Chargeable, ſince Parliamentary Aids fail'd, the King (as advis'd by his Council) reſolved upon raiſing Money by way of Loan, by Letters of Privy-Seal, ſent to the Ableſt Perſons in the Kingdom, in each of which Letters the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Name of Him, and his Heirs and Succeſſors; to re-pay the Money in Eighteen Months after the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to the Collector, and the Collectors were Ordered to pay the Sums received into the Exchequer,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:61951:408"/> and to return the Names of ſuch as went about to Delay, or Excuſe the Payment of the Money required of them. This manner of Proceedings was by all Wiſe Men thought very improper; for, by the Law no Man was bound to lend the King Money; ſo this, inſtead of Supplying the King, only tended to Alienate the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Subjects from him, and render things more Difficult in the next Parliament. Which after the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation was over, met the 6th of <hi>February;</hi> but with no better Succeſs than the laſt; For the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> began (where they left off at <hi>Oxford</hi>) with matters of Religion, and publick Grievances; <hi>viz.</hi> The Miſcarriage of the Fleet to <hi>Cadiz;</hi> the Evil-Counſellors about the King; Miſ-government, and Miſ-imployment of the King's Revenues, and an Account of the three Subſidies, and three Fifteenths Granted the 21th of King <hi>James:</hi> That new Impoſitions and Monopolies were multiplied, and ſettled to continue by Grants, Cuſtoms inhanced by the new Book of Rates; and that <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> was Levied, tho' by no Act of Parliament, and the Guard of the Seas neglected. In this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, five particular Articles were drawn up againſt Mr. <hi>Richard Mountague,</hi> wherein he had broken the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and diſturbed the Peace both of the Church and Common-wealth. Upon all which, the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> Ordered he ſhould be brought to Exemplary Puniſhment, and all his Books Burnt. Nor do I hear that ever he made any Defence or Anſwer to thoſe Articles that were brought againſt him. It is affirmed, That Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> (who was a mighty ſtickler for <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and who firſt of all ſet up this <hi>Mountague</hi>) underſtanding from the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> that the King intended to leave Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> to a Tryal, was heard to ſay, <hi>I ſeem to ſee a Cloud ariſing, and threatning the Church of</hi> England; <hi>God in his Mercy diſſipate it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Commons</hi> Queſtion'd ſeveral Perſons who were of the Council of War, in the Affairs of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> concerning the management of that Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:61951:409"/> But the King underſtanding that the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> were very buſie in ſearching the Original of a Letter under the Signet, written to the Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> for Reprieving divers <hi>Jeſuits, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> interrupted their Proceedings therein by a Meſſage ſent by Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer, demanding a Supply for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces; this was ſo highly reſented by the Houſe, that Mr. <hi>Clement Cook,</hi> one of the Members, openly Proteſted, <hi>That it was better to Dye by a Forrign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, than to be Deſtroy'd at Home.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> (another Member of the Houſe) ſeconded him with theſe <hi>Quaeries,</hi> 1. Whether the King had not loſt the Regality of the Narrow Seas, ſince the D. of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was Admiral? 2. Whether his not going as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral in this laſt Fleet, was not the Cauſe of the ill Succeſs? 3. Whether the King's Revenues has not been Impaired through his Immenſe Liberality? 4. Whether he hath not Engroſſed all Offices, and preferred his Kindred to unfit Places? 5. Whether he hath not made Sale of places of Judicature? 6. Whether <hi>Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> have not Dependence upon his Mother and Father in Law? Theſe bold Expreſſions ſo provok'd the King, that he immediately ſent Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> to Demand Satisfaction; whereupon Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> made a Speech in his own Vindication, alledging, That what he had ſaid was for the Good of the Kingdom, and not Reflecting upon any one in particular, with much more to the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And the further Debate of the matter being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd till another time, Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> in the mean time with-drew himſelf, and ſent a Letter to the Speaker to excuſe his Abſence. Sir <hi>William Walter</hi> ſpeaking his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about Grievances, ſaid, That the true cauſe of them was becauſe (as was ſaid of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th) all the King's Council rode upon one Horſe. (Thereby alluding to the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s ſole Management of all Affairs.) But for all theſe Diſcourſes, the <hi>Commons</hi> taking the King's Neceſſities into Conſideration, Voted three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, and three Fifteens; and that the Bill ſhould be
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:61951:409"/> brought in, aſſoon as the Grievances repreſented were redreſſed. They likewiſe Conſider'd of the matter of the D. of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the miſ-employing of the Revenue. But the King obſerving they did not make ſuch haſte as he Expected, in anſwering his laſt Meſſage, Summons both Houſes together; and by the Lord-Keeper complains to them for not Puniſhing Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and likewiſe for ſearching his Signet-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and juſtified the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to have acted nothing of publick Concernment without his ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and therefore forbid them to Concern themſeves any farther therein, and Blamed them for being too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the matter of Supply, and for Ordering the Bill not to be brought in, till their Grievances were heard and Anſwered, which he would not Admit of. To which the King himſelf added, <hi>He must alſo put them in Mind, That his Father, moved by their Counſel, and won by their Perſwaſion, broke the Treaties, and that be himſelf was their Inſtrument towards his Father, and was Glad to be Inſtrumental in any thing which might pleaſe the whole Body of the Realm; nor was there any in greater Favour then, than the Duke, whom they now Traduced; but that now finding him ſo far intangled in a War, that he could make no Honourable nor ſafe Retreat, they made Neceſſity their Priviledge, and ſet what Rate they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon their Supplies; a Practice not very Obliging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Kings: And whereas Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>told them,</hi> It was better for them to Dye by a Foreign Enemy, than to be Deſtroyed at Home; <hi>indeed he thought it more Honourable for a King to be Invaded, and almost De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by a Forreign Enemy, than to be Deſpiſed at Home</hi> The <hi>Commons</hi> in Anſwer to this, preſented the King with a very Dutiful Remonſtrance, acquainting him, <hi>That they gratefully Acknowledged his Majeſty's Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Affection to his People and Parliaments; that they had taken. Mr.</hi> Cook's <hi>and Dr.</hi> Turner's <hi>Words into Conſideration, and might have given a good Account thereof by this time, if His Majeſty's Meſſage had not Interrupted them; That they had the Preſidents of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:61951:410"/> Parliaments for Searching Letters of his Majeſty, and his Secretary of State, the Signet-Office, and other Records upon the like Occaſions: That it was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Priviledge of Parliaments to Complain of any Perſon of any Degree; and their Proceedings in Relation to the Duke ſhould not Prejudice either Crown or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That they were willing to Supply his Neceſſities Liberally and Faithfully, if Additions might be made of other things which concerned his Service, and were now in Conſultation amongst them.</hi> The King having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Remonſtrance, returned this Anſwer to it, <hi>That he would have them in the first place Conſult about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greatest Importance, and they ſhould have time enough for other things afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> (being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the King to be Examined by a Committee of Lords, about his Negotiations in <hi>Spain,</hi> and having been in Priſon, and prohibitted acceſs to his Majeſty ever ſince his Return) Petition'd the Houſe of Lords for his Liberty, or to come to a Tryal; who applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King, he granted a Writ for the Earl's coming to Parliament, but with a Proviſo, That his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attendance ſhould be forborn: Whereupon the Earl ſent another Petition to the Lords, that he might be heard, both as to his Reſtraint, and of what he had to ſay againſt the Duke. At this the King was much concern'd, and let the Lords know, <hi>That it was his Royal Pleaſure that the Earl of</hi> Briſtol <hi>might be ſent for as a Delinquent, to anſwer his Offences to the Houſe, and his Scandalizing the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>and the King likewiſe, by Reflection.</hi> Upon this the Earl was brought to the Bar, and being ready to be Impeached of High-Treaſon by the Attorney-General, the Earl ſaid, <hi>My Lords, I am a Freeman and Peer of the Realm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nattainted; I have ſomething to ſay of high Conſequence to His Majeſty's Service, and I beſeech your Lordſhips give me leave to Speak.</hi> The Lords thereupon bid him go on. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I accuſe that Man, the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>of High-Treaſon.</hi> And immediately he
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:61951:410"/> preſented Twelve Articles againſt him. This unexpected procedure of the Earl's, cauſed the Attorney-General to draw up a Charge againſt him, conſiſting of Eleven Articles of matters of divers Natures. And beſide theſe Articles againſt the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> exhibited Eleven others againſt the Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> The Earl like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gave in his Anſwer to each particular Article of his Impeachment. And now whilſt theſe two Peers were thus Conteſting, the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> preſented an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Duke, conſiſting of twelve Articles, to each of which the Duke made Replies: But that not Satisfying the Commons, they drew up another Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Grievances againſt the Duke, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by all means to bring down; which Declaration was read before the Bill of Subſidies: Which ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the King, that he Diſſolved the Parliament the very next Day, and thereby loſt Four Subſidies and Three Fifteenths, rather than the Duke ſhould be farther Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd by the Parliament, tho' one of the Articles againſt the Duke, was for a ſtrong Preſumption of his having Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King's Father. And thus ended this King's Second Parliament. After this Diſſolution, the King Committed the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the Tower, and Publiſhed firſt a Proclamation for Burning all Copies of the Commons Declaration, and then a Declaration ſhewing the Grounds and Reaſons of his Diſſolving this and the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral Occaſions at this time which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired conſiderable Sums of Money; for beſides the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> there was great Likelihood of a War with <hi>France,</hi> upon occaſion of the <hi>French</hi> King's uſing the <hi>Vaunt-Guard</hi> (one of the King's Men of War, lent to the <hi>French</hi> King to go againſt <hi>Genoa</hi>) with ſix other Merchants Ships, (turn'd into Men of War) againſt the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Rochel,</hi> expreſly contrary to Agreement; and the King being extreamly Troubled at it, demanded Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the <hi>French</hi> King; who Deferring to give it, the King ſeized a rich <hi>French</hi> Ship, and the <hi>French</hi> King Arreſted the Goods of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:61951:411"/> 
                     <hi>France,</hi> to the Value of about 300000<hi>l.</hi> tho' afterwards Reſtoration was made on both ſides. But the Inſolent Practices of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> belonging to the Queen, eſpecially her <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> ſoon cauſed another Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for he impoſed upon her as a Pennance, to wait upon his Servants at their Dinner, and to walk on Foot in a rainy Morning from <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe</hi> to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and from thence to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> to offer up her Prayers for the Souls of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Martyrs, <hi>i. e. Traytors,</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> that had been Executed there, himſelf the mean while riding by her in his Coach. But theſe Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being unſufferable, the Queens <hi>French</hi> Domeſticks were paid off, and ſent Home. Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King (tho' this was no more than what himſelf had done before, in ſending back all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Courtiers that came with his Queen) Arreſted all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Ships that lay in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> this was ſo ill reſented by the King, that the Peace ſo lately patch'd up, was now turn'd into an open War: And the King thereupon made uſe of thoſe Forces againſt the <hi>French</hi> which were deſigned againſt the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> complying now with the Deſires of the <hi>Rochelers,</hi> who had humbly Sued to him for Aid and Protection. But the Fleet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for their Relief, not going out till after <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> (a very improper Seaſon to ſend out a Fleet of great Ships to Sea) encountred only with Storms and Tempeſts, and return'd Home again without doing any thing, leaving the poor <hi>Rochellers</hi> in a worſe Condition than they were before.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſeſſment of the <hi>Loan</hi> (again ſet on Foot ſince the Parliaments Diſſolution) being generally Oppoſed, the People of lower Rank were Ordered to appear in the Military-Yar near St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, to be Liſted for Soldiers; it being thought fit, that thoſe who could not with their Pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſea, Gate-Houſe, and other Priſons: Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> who Petition'd his Majeſty, declaring that
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:61951:411"/> he could prove by many Preſidents, <hi>That all manner of Aids and Taxes in former Kings Reigns, were never Levied but the general Conſent of the Nobility and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament:</hi> Notwithſtanding which, he was Committed to the Gate-Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Sybthorp,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> two Eminent Preachers at Court, inſtead of Preaching the Goſpel, Preach'd up the Neceſſity and Duty of the <hi>Loan;</hi> one of them Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, That the Prince hath power to Direct his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and make Laws; and that Subjects, if they cannot exhibit Active Obedience, in caſe the thing Commanded ſhould be againſt the Law of God or Nature, yet ought to yield Paſſive Obedience; and in all other Caſes they were bound to Active Obedience. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was more expreſs to the Purpoſe, and affirmed, That the King's Royal Command in impoſing of <hi>Loans</hi> and <hi>Taxes,</hi> though without Conſent in Parliament, did Oblige the Subjects Conſcience, upon pain of Eternal Damnation. Which Poſition being highly Applauded at Court, the Sermon of Dr. <hi>Sybthorp,</hi> call'd, <hi>Apoſtolick Obedience,</hi> was approved by Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> (then Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>) and an Expreſs ſent from the King to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> to Licenſe it, which he refuſing, the King ſuſpended him from his Archiepiſcopal See, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was Granted to five Biſhops, to execute his Office.</p>
                  <p>And now the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to clear his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſhew his Diligence in his Admiral-ſhip, with ſome difficulty compleated his Naval Forces, conſiſting of 6000 Horſe and Foot, in Ten Royal Ships, and Ninety Merchant-Men, with which he ſet Sail from <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, June</hi> 27th, 1627. and Publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the King's Affection to the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> and his Diſpleaſure for the laſt Miſ-employing of his Ships againſt the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> But after all, through the Duke's ill Conduct, or Obſtinacy (in going before St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Caſtle, in the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> againſt which his Council diſſwaded him, rather than againſt the <hi>Mede,</hi> another Caſtle in that Iſland, which they might in all
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:61951:412"/> likelihood have carried, and would have been a ſafe place of Retreat in caſe of Neceſſity) this great Deſign Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, with the Death of near Two Thouſand common Souldiers, Thirty Priſoners of Note, and Forty four Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours taken. Yet to make ſome Amends for this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, a great <hi>French</hi> Ship was taken upon the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> Laden with all ſorts of Ammunition to a great Value. Alſo Sir <hi>John Pennington</hi> took 34 rich <hi>French</hi> Merchant-men homeward-bound, and brought 'em all ſafe into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The lowneſs of the Exchequer, the late Miſcarriage at the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and the preſent diſtreſſed Condition of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> being laid before the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, it was thereupon reſolved to call another Parliament, and Writs were forthwith iſſued out accordingly. And the Parliament met the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> and the King tells them, <q>That the greatneſs of the Danger requires a ſpeedy Supply, and hopes they will prove ſuch true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, as not to deceive his Expectations.</q> The firſt thing the Commons went upon, was the Grievances of the Nation; and therein the chief thing inſiſted on, was the Caſe of thoſe Gentlemen impriſoned for refuſing the <hi>Loan;</hi> and who, notwithſtanding their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> were remanded to Priſon: After the Debating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Commons reſolved, <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> 1. <hi>That no Man ought to be Reſtrained by the Command of the King or Privy-Council, without ſome Cauſe of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>ought to be granted upon request to every Man that is Reſtrained, tho' by the Command of the King, the Privy Council, or any other.</hi> 3. <hi>That if a Free-man be Impriſoned by the Command of the King, the Privy-Council, or any other, and no cauſe of ſuch Commitment expreſſed, and the ſame be returned upon an</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>granted for the ſaid Party, then he ought to be Delivered or Bailed.</hi> After which the Parliament drew up a Petition againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> to which the King gave a full and Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Anſwer; and then the Commons granted the King Five Subſidies; at which he was ſo pleaſed, that he ſent
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:61951:412"/> them Word <hi>He would deny them nothing of their Liberties which any of his Predeceſſors had Granted.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commons drew up that Memorable Bill called <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which, after many Debates about it, paſſed both Houſes, and was Preſented to the King, to which the King anſwered, <hi>The King willeth that Right be done according to the Law, and Cuſtoms of the Realm, and that the Statutes be put in due Execution, that his Subjects may have no cauſe to complain of any Wrong or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, contrary to their just Rights and Liberties; to the Preſervation whereof, he holds himſelf in Conſcience as well Obliged, as to that of his Prerogative.</hi> But this Anſwer not being thought Satisfactory, upon their further Application to the King, he ſent them this ſhort but full Anſwer, <hi>Soit Droit Fait come il est deſire:</hi> i. e. <hi>Let it be done according to your Deſire.</hi> Which Anſwer was received with great Joy by both Houſes, and the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who expreſſed it by making of Bonfires, and ringing of Bells: And the King for further Satisfaction, received again into his Favour Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> A. B. of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> and others, and likewiſe cauſed the Commiſſion of <hi>Loan</hi> and <hi>Exciſe</hi> to be Cancell'd in his Preſence. But the Commons after this drawing up a Remonſtrance againſt the Duke, and calling in Queſtion the King's taking of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the 20th of <hi>October,</hi> ſeveral Acts being firſt paſſed by them.</p>
                  <p>Much about this time Dr. <hi>Lamb</hi> (that had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly twice Arraigned, once for <hi>Necromancy,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time for a <hi>Rape</hi>) was Kill'd by the Rabble in <hi>Lothbury,</hi> for which the City was Fined 6000<hi>l.</hi> He was a great Favourite of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Devil,</hi> which made him the more Hated.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke's late Expedition to the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Denbeigh</hi> Sailed with Fifty Ships for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> but being repelled with much Loſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> deſpairing of Succeſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> himſelf reſolved to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:61951:413"/> with a more conſiderable Navy; but whilſt he was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> haſtening the fitting out of the Fleet, one <hi>John Felton,</hi> a Lieutenant, Stabb'd him to the Heart with a Knife, which he left ſticking in his Body till the Duke himſelf pull'd it out, and Died immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Felton</hi> was ſoon Apprehended by the Servants, and laden with Irons; and being ask'd what induc'd him to commit ſo bloody a Fact, he boldly anſwer'd, <hi>He Kill'd him for the Cauſe of God and his Countrey:</hi> He had likewiſe faſten'd a Paper in the Crown of his Hat, to tell the World (in caſe he had miſcarry'd in the Action) That his only motive to this Fact, was the Remonſtrance of the Commons againſt the Duke; and that he could not Sacrifice his Life in a Nobler Cauſe, than by delivering his Countrey from ſo great an Enemy. For this Fact <hi>Felton</hi> was Condemned and Hanged at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and his Body hang'd in Chains upon a Gibbet at <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However the deſigned Fleet ſet Sail under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and came to <hi>Rochel-Haven,</hi> where there was a Barricado of 1400 Yards croſs the Channel; notwithſtanding which, the Earl adventured in, paſſing the Forts and Out-works; but the Wind changing, drove the Ships foul upon each other: Which unhappy Accident made the <hi>Rochellers</hi> deſpair of Relief, and preſently Surrendred the Town. And the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> brought the Fleet ſafe home again.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament after ſome Adjournments ſitting again, the Merchants, who for refuſing to Pay Cuſtoms, had had their Effects ſeized, made grievous Complaints, this made the King ſend for the two Houſes to attend him in the Banquetting-Houſe, requiring them to paſs the Bill for <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> for the better and more ſpeedy ending all Differences. But they replyed, <hi>God's Cauſe was to be preferred before the King's, and in the first place therefore they would conſult about the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion;</hi> and ſo returning, they appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for that Purpoſe, and another for Civil matters; and many were Cenſured for reflecting on their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and for Levying <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage;</hi> but the
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:61951:413"/> King excuſed the latter as done by his expreſs Command, in a time when the Nation was in Danger to be Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Foreigners: And that ſuch things had been often done in the Reigns of his Predeceſſors, when Money could not be ſpeedily raiſed on urgent Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in a Parliamentary way. However this and other Miſunderſtandings raiſed great Heats and Jealouſies, which were Fomented to that Degree, that the Parliament was quickly after Diſſolved, without paſſing the Bill of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Soon after which the King publiſh'd a Declaration of the Cauſe thereof, and eleven of the Members were Summon'd before the Council-Table, and all committed to divers Priſons, contrary to the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right,</hi> ſo lately confirmed by the King.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this a Paper was diſperſed, containing ſome Projects how the King might encreaſe his Revenue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of a Parliament; and upon Information that the Earls of <hi>Bedford, Clare, Sommerſet,</hi> and others, had diſperſed ſome Copies of them, they were Committed: But Sir <hi>David Fowlis</hi> making it appear it was a Project of Sir <hi>Robert Dudley</hi>'s, Son to to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſixteen Years ſince, and no ways intended at this time to create any Difference between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they were releaſed.</p>
                  <p>And now divers Threatning Libels againſt the chief Miniſters of State were ſcattered abroad, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one againſt Biſhop <hi>Land,</hi> aſſuring him his Life was ſought for, he being the Fountain of Wickedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This made the great Men fear the ſitting of another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And it is ſaid <hi>Weſton</hi> the Treaſurer adviſed the King never to call any again. And a Book of Projects for Governing and raiſing Money without Parliaments, was preſented to the King. In <hi>January</hi> an Embaſſador from <hi>Spain</hi> arrived at <hi>London,</hi> whoſe buſineſs was to treat of Peace, which was ſoon Concluded, as had been with <hi>France</hi> before. On the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> 1630. the Queen was deliver'd of a Son, who was Chriſtened <hi>Charles;</hi> and Succeeded in the Kingdom: At whoſe
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:61951:414"/> Birth, it is Remarkable, a very bright Star appeared at Noon-day; which being ſhewed the King as he came from his Devotion, he greatly Rejoyced thereat, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for a fortunate Preſage: Soon after Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> Writing and Publiſhing a Book Entituled, <hi>Sion</hi>'s <hi>Plea,</hi> was Cenſured for it, and Sentenced to have his Noſe ſlit, his Ears cropp'd, and a Mark or Brand in his Fore-head, which was inflicted on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1631, <hi>Mervin,</hi> Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Caſtle-Haven,</hi> was tryed by his Peers, on the Petition of his Son and Heir, for a <hi>Rape</hi> and <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and being found Guilty, loſt his Head on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing of ſome Murmurrings and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in <hi>Scotland,</hi> went thither in Perſon, hoping to give his People of that Kingdom Satisfaction; and being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Crowned at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he called a Parliament: But they fearing the bringing in of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and other <hi>Services</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſeemed more and more to be Diſguſted. However the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Confirmed and Ratified ſome <hi>Laws,</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> conſtrued to the worſt Senſe; And which was indeed in order to the eſtabliſhing <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> there, which King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt had introduced <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. and which was apparent by the King's giving Order to the <hi>Dean</hi> of his Royal Chappel in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to have Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er read therein, according to the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1632, the King (incited thereto by Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>) ſet out a Declaration for Tollerating of Sports on the Lord's-day; which gave great Offence to all ſober Men; and for refuſing to Publiſh it, many of the beſt Miniſters were Suſpended, and deprived of their Benefices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. 1633. The Queen was delivered of her ſecond Son, named <hi>James,</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and after his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> his Death, King of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> And at that time the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> dying, Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was made Arch-biſhop in his place.</p>
                  <p>After this a Fleet was ſet out by the Supply of a Tax, called <hi>Ship-money,</hi> which removed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who had
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:61951:414"/> Confederated with the <hi>French,</hi> from before <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> and the <hi>Flandrians,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſoon Routed the French Army by Land. The King Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the good ſucceſs of this Fleet, ſent out an other which Sailing Northward ſcoured the Seas of the <hi>Dutch Buſſes,</hi> and ſpoiled their Fiſhing-trade, ſo that they were conſtrained to purchaſe their leave to Fiſh on our Coaſt, on Valuable Conſiderations: Several Gentlemen being Diſſatisfied with the raiſing of Ship-money, and being done without conſent of Parliament, refuſed to pay it; upon which the King referr'd it to his Judges, of whom Ten were for the Legality of it, and ſubcribed their Names to be Enrolled in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> (but <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> refuſed) and thereupon Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> of <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> refuſing to pay it, had Judgment given againſt him, which occaſioned murmurings among the people; of which Dr. <hi>Baſtwick, Prin</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi> taking the Advantage, writ Books reflecting on the Biſhops and Government, for which they were ſentenced to pay 5000<hi>l.</hi> Fine, loſe their Ears in the Pillory, and Impriſoned during the King's pleaſure. And Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was fined 10000<hi>l.</hi> and Impriſoned in the Tower During pleaſure; and left to the Cenſure of the High Commiſſion Court, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them; wherein the Biſhop had very hard Meaſure, his Offence being chiefly that he approved not of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Exorbitant Actions.</p>
                  <p>And now new Troubles ariſing about the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> the King marched thither with an Army, and the <hi>Scots</hi> met him near <hi>Berwick:</hi> But a Treaty being began, by means of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility, a Peace was ſoon Concluded; but they kept it no longer than the King's return to <hi>London;</hi> which occaſioned him to make a ſecond Expedition; but by this time they had entred into a ſolemn League and Covenant for the Extirpation of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and Eſtabliſhing of <hi>Preſbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 13th of <hi>April,</hi> 1640. After twelve Years interval, a Parliament met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to whom the King promiſed, That if they would Supply him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:61951:415"/> the War againſt the Scots, he would quit his claim of ſhip-money. And the Parliament ſeemed to have a great Diſpoſition to comply with the King's deſires; but it being demanded in the Houſe of Commons, what ſupply the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected? It was anſwered by Mr. Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> Twelve Subſidies: (whereas at that time, the King only deſir'd Six) This large Demand put the Houſe into ſuch a Ferment, made things look ſo ill, that the King Diſſolved the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the next Day, having only ſat 22 Days.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> not yet quieted, enter into <hi>England</hi> with an Army, and having defeated the King's Forces at <hi>Newborn,</hi> ſeized upon <hi>New-caſtle</hi> and <hi>Durham;</hi> upon which the King is willing to hear their Grievances, and receives a Petition from them, wherein they require a Parliament to be called in <hi>England,</hi> without which they could have no Redreſs: Declaring their Intention not to lay down Arms, till the Reformed Religion was ſettled in both Nations upon ſure Grounds, and the Cauſers and Abetters of their preſent Troubles, <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Strafford</hi> were brought to publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in Parliament. After which ſeveral Peers, the City of <hi>London,</hi> and divers other places, Petition'd the King for the ſitting of a Parliament, whereupon the King Summon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Parliament to meet <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1640. when the People were every where in a Ferment and Prejudice, inveighing if not againſt the King, yet againſt his Miniſters of State.</p>
                  <p>In this Parliament all Ceremonies in the Church were ſuppreſſed, except thoſe uſed in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> were Impeached of High-Treaſon and committed to the <hi>Tower:</hi> Divers of the Judges that had declared for Ship-money were Voted Delinquents; and Judge <hi>Berkley</hi> Arreſted by the Uſher of the Black Rod for High-Treaſon, as he ſate in the King's-Bench-Court.</p>
                  <p>The King being vexed at the proceeding of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons complained to the Peers, who promiſed to Labour for a Moderation and good Underſtanding between the King and his two Houſes. But matters yet running high,

And as they returned by <hi>White-Hall,</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very opprobrious Threatnings againſt the King and his Counſellors; which made him Fortify his Pallace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Guard of the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> Gentlemen, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their Service to defend his Perſon from any Inſults. The Parliament hereupon apprehending a fear of Danger that threaten'd them, aſſumed a Guard for their Defence, conſtituting the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Captain of it, and appointed an extraordinary Aſſembly in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and ſoon after committed twelve Piſhops Priſoners to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which ſcared moſt, if not all the reſt, from giving their Attendance; and many Miniſters of State were Accuſed and Cenſured: And the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> upon his Tryal, being accuſed of many things, and plainly anſwering all that by Articles was laid to his Charge, and the Court Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without prefixing any time of meeting, the Commons proceeded to draw up and diſpatch a Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which the King with great difficulty, and ſome reluctancy of Mind, Signed; but the Warrant for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution he laboured much to defer, ſaying, <hi>He had heard the Cauſe, and believed in his Conſcience the Earl was not guilty of Treaſon, and yet he could not clear him of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour; but hoped a way might be found out to ſatisfie Juſtice, and their Fears, without oppreſſing his Conſcience:</hi> and had conſulted about it with his Judges and Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had Signed the Bill; as alſo a Bill for the ſitting of the Parliament during the pleaſure of both Houſes; which
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:61951:416"/> laſt was occaſioned for ſatisfying the <hi>Scots,</hi> who required vaſt Sums of Money. However the Earl was Executed, tho' the King laboured much to ſave him, propoſing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Impriſonment, and many other things.</p>
                  <p>He was attended at his Execution on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and to this Effect addreſſed him to the People; <hi>viz. That he was come thither to pay the last Debt he ow'd to Sin, with a good Hope of riſing to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that he Dyed willingly, Forgave all, and patiently ſubmitted, declaring himſelf Innocent of the Crimes charged against him; wiſhing Proſperity to the King and People: He adviſed his Adverſaries to repent of their violent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against him, ſaying, He thought it a ſtrange way to write in Blood the beginning of Reformation, and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom: however, he wiſhed his Blood might rest, and not cry against them; declaring he Dyed in the Communion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>for whoſe Proſperity he Prayed; and concluded with a Deſire that the Spectators would pray for him.</hi> And then had his Head ſtricken off.</p>
                  <p>There having been about this time ſome Tumults made about <hi>White-Hall</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the King being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd they were encouraged by the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and five Members of the Houſe of Commons, the King demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe five Members, whom he accuſed of High-Treaſon, as alſo the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Peers; but they were refuſed to be delivered: Whereupon he came with about 500 armed Men to the Houſe of Commons, where the Speaker reſigned the Chair to him; but looking about, and not ſeeing thoſe he expected, (for upon Notice, they were withdrawn) he declared his good Intentions to the Parliament, ſaying, <hi>He hoped they would ſend him thoſe Members againſt whom he had matters of high Concern.</hi> But they were ſo far from doing it, that they put the City of <hi>London</hi> in Arms, and Adjourned their ſitting for five days; forbidding the Citizens to help the King to find out any of the accuſed Members; and ſo far were they from it; that the Parliament ſitting again, they carry'd them in Triumph, and placed them in their Seats, ſhouting and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as they paſſed by <hi>White-hall;</hi> and to leſſen the King's
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:61951:416"/> Power, the Parliament ſent Letters to the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, commanding the Militia to draw up in Arms: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they found that upon occaſion, more than 20000 Men could be got in a Readineſs. Theſe proceedings made the King withdraw to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> whoſe abſence much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Parliaments Authority among the People; and to endear them to the Citizens, they adjourned from <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> and ſent their Mandates to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Sea-port Towns, ſtrictly forbidding them to Obey any of the King's Orders unleſs they were confirmed by them. This more weaken'd his Power than all their former Proceedings; which the King, by an early precaution in Gariſoning thoſe parts, might have prevented.</p>
                  <p>The King conſidering that things were likely to go ill, and that he had given away his Power, and could not diſſolve this Parliament, he endeavoured by mild Terms to win them to his Intereſt, and Writ from <hi>Windſor,</hi> proteſting his good meaning towar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commons drew up an humble Remonſtrance, which ſeemed ſo unreaſonable to the Peers, as to what therein they propoſed, that they rejected it, till they ſaw the Commons uniting againſt them, and then Meſſengers were ſent to the King with it, who with ſome Reſervation yielded to part of it, and denyed the reſt; which not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying them, they proceeded to Petition the King, That the accuſed Members might be freed from all imputation of Guilt, which was Granted.</p>
                  <p>During the King's being buſie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and Rebellion broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered but the Night before it began to the Lords-Juſtices, by <hi>Owen O Conally;</hi> by which means <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſome other places, were ſecured, and divers of the Conſpirators appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: However it was carry'd on with ſuch a Rage and Fury, by the Encouragement of the Popiſh <hi>Prieſts, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> that nothing for a time but Slaughter and miſerable Cruelties on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were to be

The King to Redreſs this, Solicited the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament to ſend ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Contendings between the King and Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> continuing to increaſe, many that feared the ſad Events, left the Land; others retired to lead private Lives. <hi>Mary,</hi> the King's Eldeſt Daughter, being Married to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by Approbation of Parliament, the Queen went over with her, and the King cauſed all <hi>Popiſh Priests</hi> to be baniſh'd the Kingdom, and the Penal Statutes to be put in Execution againſt <hi>Papists.</hi> Yet the Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Tax the King about harkning to the Change of Religion, and that he had given cauſe to the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> caſting many Reflections on the Queen, which conſtrained him to publiſh his Declaration to wipe off theſe Imputations; but this doing little good, he retired with Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Son, the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and others, to <hi>York;</hi> Summoning the Nobles, Knights of the Garter, and all ſuch as held Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the Crown, by Lands or Service. But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:61951:417"/> ſtrictly forbid it: Yet many went, and among them ſeveral Members of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The King ſeeing no good by fair means to be done, he Commanded all the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Men to meet him at <hi>Howard-Moor</hi> near <hi>York,</hi> where there appeared about 60000; and with about 20000 he returned to <hi>York,</hi> Commanding the reſt to return to their Reſpective Homes. In the mean while the Parliament was borrowing Money of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> on the Publick Faith; and raiſing 10000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe, they ſent them towards <hi>York;</hi> of which the King had no ſooner Notice, but with a ſlender Force he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Hull,</hi> and demanded enterance; but Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> the Governour, appearing on the Walls, fell on his Knees, and entreated his Majeſty not to deſire that of him which he could not Grant, by reaſon of the Truſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him by the Parliament, whereupon he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Traytor; and the King ſent to the Parliament to complain of this Affront, and require a Treaty tending to a Reconciliation, promiſing to repair to them if they would leave <hi>London,</hi> and make choice of ſome other fitting place; but they refuſed it. Whereupon he Proclaimed all thoſe Guilty of Treaſon that aſſiſted them either with Money or Supplies; and threatned to deprive the <hi>Londoners</hi> of their <hi>Charter,</hi> if they offended herein. Then he Fortified <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark</hi> and <hi>Barwick,</hi> and ſought to gain <hi>Hull</hi> by Force, but failed in the Attempt: And the Parliament having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> their General, the King repaired to <hi>Notingham,</hi> and there ſet up his Standard, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable Army; ſo that now to the great Trouble of moſt People, War was prepared for on both ſides, with much Vigor and Reſolution; in which many Gallant Men loſt their Lives. And Prince <hi>Charles</hi> ſeeing his Father's Affairs in a deſperate Condition, Sailed for the <hi>Scillys,</hi> from whence he was Invited by the Parliament to return for <hi>London;</hi> but not thinking it ſafe, he went to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and continued with his Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> till he heard the ſad News of his Father's Death. In the mean while Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> the King's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, Sons to his Siſter the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> came

                  <p>After ſeveral Skirmiſhes, and the taking ſome Towns on both ſides, the two Armies drew near each other, and the King perceiving himſelf Strong, upon the Earl of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s coming in with a conſiderable Force of <hi>Welch,</hi> reſolved to out-march <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and reach <hi>London,</hi> and to that end got a days March before him; but Scorning to be purſu'd by a Subject, he changed his Meaſures, Faced about, and both Parties Facing, between <hi>Keinton</hi> and <hi>Edge-hill</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> on the 23d of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1642, a ſharp Battel was Fought between them, in which on both ſides were ſlain between 5 and 6000 Men; and the Slaughter had been much greater, had not Night come on and parted them. After this the King took in the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Banbury,</hi> and ſome other places. The Parliament to ſtrengthen their Army, Voted, That all Apprentices that would Liſt, ſhould be Free from their Maſters, and afterward received into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice again; whereupon they gained conſiderable Recruits. Then ſolemnly invited the <hi>Scots</hi> to their Aſſiſtance; which the King by his Letters to the Privy-Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> laboured to prevent, but in vain: Yet ſeveral of the Lords and Commons preſented a Petition to him at <hi>Cole-brook,</hi> and had anſwer, He would expect them at <hi>Windſor Caſtle,</hi> and deſired them to haſten the Treaty: But this they did to gain time till <hi>Eſſex</hi> was Recruited, which made the King haſten to Secure <hi>Brainford,</hi> where happened a ſharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, tho' at laſt he forced his way; but upon <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s haſtening with his Regular Forces, and the <hi>London-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> he retired, for fear of being hemmed in, to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and becauſe this happened in a time of Treaty, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Voted to have no Accommodation; yet after allowed it, if he would leave his Army and come to them: But this was Rejected, and the War waxed fierce, ſo that with various Succeſs Towns were taken, and Parties routed on both ſides, by turns, whilſt the Counties of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Suffolk, Eſſex, Hartford, Cambridge,</hi> Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> were Authorized by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to Aſſociate under the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark.</hi> And the Queen arriving with Officers, Ammunition, and Money
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:61951:418"/> from <hi>Holland,</hi> was received at <hi>York</hi> by the Earls of <hi>New caſtle</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi> And theſe Diſturbances at Home, gave the <hi>Iriſh</hi> an Opportunity to Rebel again at the Inſtigation of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who to that Purpoſe ſent two Letters, one to <hi>Owen O Neal,</hi> and the other to all the Arch-biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Nobles, and People of the Kingdom; Commanding thoſe who had already appeared in the Quarrel, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting others to take Arms; wickedly approving the Maſſacre, and beſtowing on them his Benediction, with plenary Pardons and Abſolutions for whatever they ſhould act; ſo that much Blood was again ſhed, which cauſed (by the Mediation of thoſe that were Peaceably inclin'd) ſeveral new Treaties to be ſet on Foot between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but they came to nothing, being ſtill croſſed by thoſe that hoped for Advantages by the Diſtractions of the times. And the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> beſieging <hi>Litchfield-Cloſe,</hi> was there Slain; but his Soldiers took it, and the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> Priſoner. And now they proceeded to draw up Articles of high Treaſon againſt the Queen, ſome of which were, That ſhe pawned the Crown-Jewels in <hi>Holland;</hi> That ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe a Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Parliament; and that ſhe was in the Head of a <hi>Popiſh Army</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> This was carried to the Lords by <hi>Pym,</hi> who ſeemed at firſt to be Surprized, but after agreed to it.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> and <hi>George Boucher,</hi> were Hang'd at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> on pretence they deſigned to betray the City to the King; and on the like pretence Mr. <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Challonor</hi> were Executed on the Account of <hi>London</hi>- And during theſe Heats, Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was Attainted of High-Treaſon, and loſt his Head.

But briefly to paſs over this Bloody Scene, which cannot be very Grateful to <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> I come to a cloſe of this unhappy Reign.</p>
                  <p>Having got the King in their Hands, they ſent him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to <hi>Holmby-Caſtle,</hi> whilſt many earneſtly Laboured for an Accommodation; the <hi>Surry</hi>-men Petitioned, but were ſet upon by the Soldiers, ſome Slain, and many Wounded; nor fared the <hi>Kentiſh</hi>-men better.

When eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> he was there made Priſoner by Coll. <hi>Hammond</hi> in <hi>Carisbrook-Caſtle;</hi> and it was Voted,
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:61951:420"/> No further Addreſs be made to the King. But that was afterward Annulled, and the King's Conceſſions Voted Satisfactory; and things were in a fair way to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Army Officers knowing their Commiſſions laſted but with the War, dealing under-hand with ſome deſigning Men in the Parliament-Houſe, who under pretence of a Publick Good, had all along along aimed at Self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the Soldiers being by Intereſt and Promiſes made of their Party; all ſuch Members as were for the Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, were by Military Force excluded the Houſe, and the King brought to <hi>Hurst-Caſtle,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Windſor;</hi> and his Party went extreamly to wreck at <hi>Maidſtone, Ponifract, Bow, Stratford, Kingſton;</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> after a brave Reſiſtance, being taken, Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle</hi> were ſhot to Death, tho' Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been given them.</p>
                  <p>And now thoſe Members that were left in the Houſe of Commons, contrary to the Conſent of the Lords, being backed by the Army, made an <hi>Act</hi> [as they called it] for the Tryal of the King; and Erected a Tribunal, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them a <hi>High-Court of Juſtice,</hi> to that end, of which <hi>John Bradſhaw,</hi> a <hi>Serjeant</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> was <hi>Preſident,</hi> and 56 others as Judges; and the King being called before them, and accuſed of ſeveral Crimes, as that he gave cauſe for the Cruel Blood-ſhed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> that he had Proclaimed War, in ſetting up his Standard againſt the Parliament; That he had commiſſioned his Son and others, to wage War; and therefore was pronounced a Traytor, a Tyrant, and an Enemy to the Common-wealth of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> To this Charge the King refuſed to Anſwer, or to acknowledge the Authority of the Court, offering his Reaſons; but they were not admitted; and being ſeveral times brought before them, and urged thereunto, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, on the the 27th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. the Sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he the ſaid <hi>Charles Steu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> was fallen from all Dignity, was Guilty of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to be put to Death, by Severing his Head from his Body, for being a Tyrant, a Murtherer, and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Common-Wealth. The Sentence being read,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:61951:420"/> the Court ſtood up in Confirmation of it, as an Act and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of them all; and the King offering to ſpeak, was Violently Hurried away by the Guard: And tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſador, the <hi>Scots</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, interceeded to ſtay Execution, he was on the 30th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and there being attended (on a Scaffold before the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-Houſe) by Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he made a Profeſſion of his Innocency, and of his Faith, forgiving his Enemies, and praying to God not to lay his Blood to their Charge, ſeeming troubled that he had conſented to the Sentence againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and after this and much more to the like Purpoſe, he kneeling down, gave the Sign to the Executioner, by ſtretching out his Arms, and at one Blow had his Head ſeparated from his Body; which being put in a Coffin covered with Velvet, was carried to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and buried in a Vault in St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chappel.</p>
                  <p>Thus, without Preſident, fell King <hi>Charles,</hi> when he had Reigned 23 Years, 10 Months, and 3 Days, being the 24th Year of his Reign, and 49th of his Age.

This being done in a full Treaty, greatly Diſpleaſed the King, becauſe he had his Commiſſion, and had acted in his Cauſe; but the neceſſity of his affairs, made him paſs it over, and he Condeſcended to moſt of the Propoſals.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſoon heard of their Treaty, and to prevent its taking effect, ſent an <hi>Army</hi> under <hi>Cromwel</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and manning out a Fleet, Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> fell in with Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Squadron, ſinking and burning moſt of the Ships he Commanded for the King; however matters being agreed on, the King haſtened to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Landed at <hi>Spey,</hi> where ſeveral Lords came to him; and the Town of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> preſented him with 1500<hi>l.</hi> which ſo angered the Eſtates, that they ſtrictly forbid all other Towns under great Penalties to do the like. And coming to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> he was a ſecond time Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King, <hi>July</hi> 16. <hi>Anno</hi> 1650.

                  <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament (as they pretended) found out ſeveral Plots againſt them, for which Sir <hi>Henry Hyde,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Brown Buſhel</hi> were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; and ſoon after, Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Miniſter.</p>

                  <pb n="610" facs="tcp:61951:426"/>
                  <p>About this time the Duke of <hi>Glouoeſter</hi> was ſent by the Parliament (who had kept him in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> ever ſince his Father was Beheaded) to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> whence he was Conducted to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> his Siſter at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> and after he had ben there a little time, he went to <hi>Paris</hi> to his Brother and his Mother.</p>
                  <p>On the 20th of <hi>April</hi> following, General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> with M. G. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and M.

And then in the room of this <hi>Rump-Parliament</hi> thus Diſſolved, a Council of State was Conſtituted, conſiſting of the chief Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſuch of the Members of the late Parliament as they had a Kindneſs for; and in this Council of State the Supreme Authority of the Nation was ſaid to Conſiſt, and Obedience thereunto required, as fully as to the Parliament, when Sitting, and Judges, Sheriffs, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all other Civil Officers, to act in their reſpective Offices as before, till a new Repreſentative ſhould be choſen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> thought this Change might be to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but they found themſelves miſtaken; for the new Governours omitted nothing that might advance their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Preparations, and fitted out the Fleet with great application, and with ſuch Succeſs, that tho' one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generals <hi>(Dean)</hi> was ſlain in the Fight, yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> were again Defeated, ſix of their beſt Ships being Burnt, and two bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not one Ship loſt or diſabled; and (except General <hi>Dean</hi>) but one Captain ſlain.</p>
                  <p>And now a new Parliament was Summoned, choſen by <hi>Cromwel</hi> out of the Several Counties of <hi>England,</hi> of the moſt Religious and Sanctified Perſons he could Nominate: This was called the <hi>Little-Parliament;</hi> and indeed they did Little, exept it were making an Act againſt <hi>Tythes,</hi> and an Act for <hi>Marriages</hi> by a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> and then being weary of their Power, they gave it up to <hi>Oliver</hi> who had given it to them. And now another ſort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment comes next: For the Officers of the Army had drawn up a new Syſtem, and preſented it to <hi>Oliver,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to take the Government upon him, under the Title of <hi>Protector of the Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> He at firſt made a ſhew of refuſing it, (tho' every one believ'd there was nothing that he deſir'd more) but being further preſſed to it, he accepted of it, and was that afternoon inſtall'd at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> had been already ſeverely beaten, and were extreamly Solicitous for a Peace, yet that they might get the better Terms, they reſolved to try the Fortune of War once more; which yet prov'd more in-auſpicious to them than the former, for in the next Battel, which was on the 29th of <hi>July,</hi> 1653. Admiral <hi>Van Trump</hi> was Slain, and 33 Sail of Ships ſunk to the bottom of the Ocean, out of which 1200 men were Sav'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> taken up out of Boats, and ſwimming in the Sea. This was ſo great a Mortification to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the States were afraid of a general Revolt: And therefore they forthwith apply'd themſelves to <hi>Oliver</hi> for a Peace, which in the Infancy of his new Government, he was willing to Grant upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Terms; tho' they were reduc'd to ſo low a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he might have made what Terms he pleas'd. The Succeſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> made other Nations fear <hi>Cromwel.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> coming early to Congratulate his Authority, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> came in a Splendid Embaſſy to ſue for Peace: Nor were the <hi>French</hi> backward to own his Power.

                  <p>The Commons in Parliament having Voted the King a Supply of 2500000<hi>l,</hi> great Naval Preparations were made, which cauſed our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch</hi> to fear a Storm, and therefore they thought it convenient to provide for their Safety; and indeed, a Miſunderſtanding happening between both Nations, an Order of Council was made, giving Letters of Repriſal againſt them, and about 112 Sail were taken by our Frigats, Men of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt of them being adjudged Lawful Prizes; and hereupon the King ſet out his Declaration, touching his Proceedings for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Subjects of the States: Whilſt theſe things were doing, a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> under the Diſguiſe of a <hi>Sweed,</hi> coming from <hi>Guinea,</hi> publickly reported <hi>De Ruyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander, had Deſtroyed all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Factories on that Coaſt, which for a time cauſed much Conſternation among the Merchants trading thither, but it proving Falſe, he was Sentenced and Whipt through <hi>London.</hi> However, the Parliament being Prorogued, War was Proclaimed on the 2d of <hi>March</hi> 1664, and a General Faſt ſucceeded, for a Bleſſing on the King's Forces to be employed againſt them; and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> attempting with his Fleet to Plunder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantation of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> was beaten off; but whilſt many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters happened at Sea, a worſe Calamity befell at Land; for by reaſon of the great Heat in the Spring, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cool breathing Winds to purge and purify the Air, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1665, a <hi>Plague</hi> began fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Rage, ſo that in <hi>London</hi> that Year 97306 Perſons of
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:61951:430"/> all Degrees dyed; and of theſe were accounted 68596, of the Plague. However the War was carryed on with great <hi>Vigour,</hi> and on the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being Admiral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy, the two Fleets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and after a long and obſtinate Fight which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued many Hours, bloody and doubtful, the <hi>Dutch</hi> gave way, and ſuch as got off ſtood to their own Coaſt: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> having taken, burnt, ſunk, and ſhattered about thirty of their Ships, and ſlain and taken Priſoners about 8000; tho' not without Loſs conſiderable on our own part, which was chiefly occaſioned by moſt of the great Ships crouding about the Admiral, to ſcreen him from the Fury of the Enemy, and prevent his being laid on Board by Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips: Thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> of Note who loſt their Lives in this Engagement were the Earls of <hi>Falmouth, Portland, Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lawſon</hi> dyed of his Wounds ſoon after, and 2063 <hi>Dutch</hi> Priſoners were brought to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> whereof 13 were Commanders. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a publick Thankſgiving was performed for this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: the King likewiſe Conferred the Honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood on ſuch Sea-Commanders as had eminently Signalized their Courage and Conduct in the Action.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> ſtill continuing to Rage, a Faſt was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſolemnly to be held every firſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Month<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till it ſhould ceaſe; and Fires were continued in the Streets of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for three Days and Nights, to purify the Air; whilſt the King <hi>&amp;c</hi> made his progreſs through the greater part of <hi>England,</hi> the two Houſes of Parliament attending him at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and upon his laying before them them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſupply to maintaine the charges of the War, the Commons Voted him 1250000<hi>l.</hi> And <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term by Proclamation was Adjournd from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to that City: But the Plague abating, the Parliament and Courts of Judicature returned to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as did the King and Queen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King envying the growing greatneſs of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> more than any love he had for the <hi>Dutch</hi> [as it afterward plainly appeared] Joyned with them and was

                  <p>The Fleets being abroad, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> then Joynt-Admirals of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the latter with a Squadron of fifty Ships, the former being to the Weſtward with the reſt, engaged 80 of the <hi>Dutch</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and maintained the Fight two Days; when on the third, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> coming in, the Fight continued very Bloody, till the Evening, with much Loſs on both ſides; and then the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtood away to their own Coaſt. In this Fight the Royal <hi>Prince</hi> was ſtranded on the <hi>Galloper,</hi> and burnt by the <hi>Dutch:</hi> Sir <hi>George Aſcough,</hi> who Commanded her, being taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and carryed into <hi>Holland.</hi> About ſix or ſeven Weeks after, there happened another Sea-Fight, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> chaſed the <hi>Dutch</hi> to their own Coaſts, and on the 7th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Holms</hi> burnt divers <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants Ships in the <hi>Fly,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Baudaris</hi> upon the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of <hi>Scheling,</hi> and four <hi>French</hi> Men of War ſalling in with our Fleet, miſtaking it in Foggy-weather for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> one of them of 54 Guns was taken.</p>
                  <p>On the Second of <hi>September,</hi> 1666, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> began the dreadful Fire of <hi>London,</hi> at one <hi>Faringdons,</hi> a <hi>Baker</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> the back-ſide of <hi>Fiſh-ſtreet-hill:</hi> It continued Burning until <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and that time deſtroyed the greateſt part of the City. But the beſt Account of it being Engraven on the North-ſide of the <hi>Monument</hi> Erected in the perpetual Remembrance thereof, take as followeth;</p>
                  <p>In the Year of Chriſt 1666, the ſecond Day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> Eaſtward from hence, at the Diſtance of Two hundred and two foot (the heighth of this Column) a terrible Fire broke out about Midnight; which dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on by a high Wind, not only waſted the adjacent Parts, but alſo very remote Places, with incredible noiſe and fury.

<pb n="621" facs="tcp:61951:431"/> Streets. Of the ſix and twenty Wards it utterly deſtroy'd fifteen, and left eight other ſhattered and half burnt. The Ruins of the City were four hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Acres, from the Tower by the <hi>Thames</hi> ſide to the Temple-Church, and the North-Eaſt Gate along the City-Wall to <hi>Holbourn-Bridge.</hi> To the Eſtates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Citizens it was mercileſs, but to their Lives very favourable, that it might in all things reſemble the laſt Conflagration of the World. The Deſtruction was ſudden, for in a ſmall ſpace of time the ſame City was ſeen moſt flouriſhing, and reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal Fire had baffled all humane Counſels and Indeavours in the Opinion of all, it ſtopt as it were by a Command from Heaven, and was on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>This Dreadful Fire was both begun and carried on by Papiſts, as appeared by <hi>Hubert</hi>'s own Confeſſion, who was Executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for the ſame; and alſo by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Depoſitions given in to the Parliament: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the following Inſcription was Engraven round about the <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> of the <hi>Monument,</hi> viz.</p>

But the King and the Dukes party were for offering Expedients for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho' the Duke ſhould come a Papiſt to the Crown.
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:61951:434"/> But this would not content the Commons. And there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing ſome heats between the Lords and Commons about the Biſhops Voting in Capital Caſes, the King thinking he could expect but little from them, Prorogued them to a more convenient ſeaſon; but in a little time after diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and called another, which he hoped to find more to his purpoſe. But during the interval of the Parliament, Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was tryed for the Popiſh Plot, and acquitted, before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroges,</hi> whoſe carriage was ſo different in this Tryal from what it had been in thoſe before, that he was ſhrewdly ſuſpected to have ſome very feeling Reaſons for it: For after this Tryal, <hi>Scrogs</hi> was more violent againſt <hi>Oats</hi> and the <hi>Whigs,</hi> than he had been before againſt the Papiſts. And now there was ſet on foot a new Popiſh Plot to ſham the old one, and put a Plot upon the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> which was called The <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> Plot; (the Papers relating to it being found under Madam <hi>Celiers Meal-tub</hi>) the deſign whereof was, To leave Papers and Libels of dangerous things againſt the Government in the Houſes of the moſt Eminent perſons active in the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, by them called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and then to inform the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſuch perſons where theſe papers were left, were dangerous perſons to the King and Goverment; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their Houſes being ſearch'd, and theſe papers found there, it ſhould have been ſufficient evidence to condemn them. The Tryal how this would do, was firſt made upon Colonel <hi>Mansfel,</hi> a worthy Gentelman, who was Proſecuted for it, but the examination of it being left to Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> the Attorney-General, his Report was, That <hi>Mansfel</hi> was innocent, and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> (at that time the Papiſts Tool, and who had left the Papers in <hi>Mansfels</hi> Lodgings) was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Upon which <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was committed to Priſon, where he mad ae thorow diſcovery of this curſed intreague; and Sir <hi>Wil. Jones</hi> was turn'd out of his place, for his honeſt Report. And indeed from this time forward, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Creatures ruled all things under the King, ſo that now the whole Deſign of the Government ſeem'd to be to ſham the <hi>Popiſh</hi>-Plot, and ſet up another in it's room,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:61951:435"/> againſt all the honeſt Gentlemen in the Nation. For the Parliament having oppos'd the Duke's Succeſſion, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to deſtroy all thoſe Gentlemen that were active againſt Popery, and to bring Popery in, <hi>Per fas &amp; ne fas.</hi> And this appear'd plainly, not only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Duke reign'd as High-Commiſſioner, and by whoſe Means the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was Try'd, Condemn'd and deſign'd to be Executed, had he not Providentially made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, but in <hi>England</hi> alſo; as appear'd by <hi>Dangerfield's</hi> Evidence firſt, and afterwards by <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> his Plot: For after ſeveral Prorogations of the Parliament before they ſat, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 17th of <hi>October</hi> 1679. to the 21th of <hi>October,</hi> 1680, they then ſat; but found things had been carried on ſo high againſt the Intereſt of the Nation, by a ſort of Men that were called <hi>Tories,</hi> and that joyn'd with the Popiſh Party to ſtifle the Popiſh-Plot, and in advancing Arbitrary Power, declaring their Abhorrence of Petitioning the King for the ſitting of the Parliament, that they reſolved to make Examples of ſome of them, Voting againſt Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> and ſome others; who were preferr'd by the Court, for being againſt the Intereſt of the People: In this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after a full Hearing by the Houſe of Lords, the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> one of the Popiſh Lords in the Tower, was found Guilty of High-Treaſon, Condemn'd and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the Parliament being high for the Bill of <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> it having Paſſed the Houſe of Commons, the King firſt P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, one <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Everard</hi> his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man, and one of the Diſcoverers of the Popiſh-plot, to write him a villanous Libel againſt the King and the Duke; this Libel was to be Printed, and put into the Pockets of the moſt Active Men in the Kingdom againſt Popery, both Lords and Commons; who were thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be taken up, and Try'd for High-Treaſon; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard</hi> writes this Libel, and brings <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to his Chamber to hear it Read; but firſt Diſcovers the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:61951:435"/> to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and plants him in his Cloſet, where he might hear the Libel Read, unknown to <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> after having heard the Libel, <hi>Everard</hi> asks <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> how he lik'd it, who told him very well. Upon this, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> goes to the King, and diſcovers the whole matter to him; the King ſeem'd to be very well pleas'd, and orders <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to be taken up and Committed to Priſon, which was accordingly done: Tho' Sir <hi>William</hi> was afterwards told, when he went from the King, that the King was highly diſpleas'd with him for this piece of Service, and ſaid he had broke all his Meaſures. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> being taken and Committed Priſoner to <hi>Newgate;</hi> he was Examined by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and Sheriff <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and ſeem'd willing to diſcover the whole Deſign the next Day. But the next Day he was remov'd to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there kept a Cloſe Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>And now the Parliament met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where one of the firſt things they Debated was the Buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who was Impeached by the Commons; but the Lords refuſed to joyn in the Impeachment; which the Commons look'd upon as a Denyal of Juſtice; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſign was to ſtifle <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Evidence, in whoſe Plot ſome Perſons of the higheſt Rank were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, they Voted againſt the Tryal of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> by any inferiour Court whatſoever. This being the Poſture of Affairs, the King on the 28th of <hi>March</hi> Diſſolves the Parliament, and immediately took Coach and went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> leaving both Houſes in Amaze, and the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> in great Confuſion, as was the whole Nation ſoon after upon the News of it. This Diſſolution was follow'd by a Declaration, as his Father had done before him. This being done, the Buſineſs was to bring in a new Plot to deſtroy the Proteſtants, but <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> muſt firſt be taken out of the way, being Try'd before <hi>Pemberton</hi> (who was made Lord Chief Juſtice, as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for that Purpoſe) and ſoon after Executed at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> with <hi>Oliver Plunket,</hi> the Titular Primate of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> for the Popiſh-Plot.</p>
                  <p>About this time the City of <hi>London</hi> having choſen

But the Popiſh Faction, reſolv'd to go on with their Show; and therefore <hi>Colledge</hi> was Committed Priſoner to the Tower, and ſoon after a Bill prefer''d againſt him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they had a <hi>Jury</hi> to their Mind, who found it <hi>Billa vera,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was had down to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Tryed for a Deſign to Seiz the King there at the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and tho' he made an excellent Defence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Foul play that was offered him, yet he was brought in Guilty, and ſoon after Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, declaring his Innocency, and that he was the firſt but ſhould not be the laſt, that ſuffer'd for his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, in which he was a true Prophet. The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was next Indicted of High-Treaſon, but the Evidence againſt him being only ſome of thoſe Baffled Witneſſes, and other Profligate Perſons, whom the Grand-Jury could not believe, and therefore brought in the Bill <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> This was a great Mortification to the Popiſh Party, who deſir'd nothing more than to take off this Noble Lord; and therefore finding the great Obſtacle to their Deſigns were Juries, it was reſolved by the Faction to take away the City <hi>Charter,</hi> and thereby their Power
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:61951:436"/> of chuſing Sheriffs: And accordingly a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> which was Proſecuted with that Earneſtneſs, that notwithſtanding the Learned Pleading of the City Council in the behalf of the <hi>Charter,</hi> Judgment was given againſt it, and their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Franchiſes ſeized into the King's Hand. And the Mayor and Sheriffs were appointed by the King, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Commiſſion from him, during his Pleaſure.

About this time alſo two Famous Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors came into <hi>England</hi> from Princes never known to have ſent Embaſſadors here before, the one from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs was to eſtabliſh a Peace in relation to <hi>Tangier,</hi> and the other was from the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> who preſented the King with ſeveral Diamonds, and other things of great Value.</p>
                  <p>And now the World began to ſee the Cauſe of the City <hi>Charter</hi>'s being taken away; for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Party, that now ruled all things at their own Pleaſure, were reſolved to take off all thoſe Gentlemen that were moſt Zealous for the Proteſtant Religion, and that in Parliament had been moſt forward for the Bill of <hi>Excluſion.</hi> And this was to be done by Pretence of a Plot to take away the Life of the King and the Duke, and alter the Government; and this was pretended to be executed at the <hi>Rye-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Hartfor-ſhire,</hi> as the King ſhould come back from <hi>New-market,</hi> and was ſaid to be prevented by a Fire happening at <hi>New-Market,</hi> which cauſed the King to come away ſooner than he intended, and ſo before the Conſpirators were ready.

That Noble Lord was taken out of his own Houſe at <hi>Caiſho-Berry</hi> near <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Committed to the Tower upon this Plot, where he ſent for his own Servants to attend him, and his own <hi>Cook</hi> to dreſs his Meat (being Jealous perhaps of Sir <hi>Tho.

<pb n="634" facs="tcp:61951:438"/> brought to them that they might ſee them, were told, They were to ſit upon the Body, and not upon the Cloaths, and ſo were deny'd the ſight of them. And when they were about adjourning till the next Day, before they gave in their Verdict, they were told, they muſt give it in preſently, and not ſtir till they had done it, becauſe the King ſtay'd for it: And ſo they were hurried into a Verdict of the Earl's being <hi>Felo-de-ſe:</hi> And when from ſome Information of a <hi>Raſor</hi> thrown out of the Window of the Earl's Cloſet, and ſome other Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Circumſtances, one Mr. <hi>Lawrence Braddon</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Diſcover that the Earl was Murder'd, and did not Kill himſelf, he was proſecuted for it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Violence imaginable, as if the Diſcovery of the Earl's Murther, had been the Arraignment of the Government: After this the Honourable <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> was alſo Try'd as one of the Council of Six, and for Writing and Publiſhing a Libel, (tho' it was only found in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his own Cloſet) and not prov'd to be his own Writing neither, but by the Similitude of Hands; which Writing (had it been prov'd his) was only an Anſwer to Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Treatiſe of Abſolute Monarchy, (which had been the Deſign not only of this, but of the two preceding Reigns) yet this Evidence (ſuch as it was) was ſufficient with ſuch Juries as then were pack'd for their Purpoſe, to find the Collonel Guilty, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Learned Defence he made for himſelf: So that he was Condemned and Beheaded, dying with a Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind worthy of himſelf. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> (who was alſo one of the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Council of Six) had for ſome time abſconded, but now upon his Submiſſion to his Father and his Unkle, was admitted to Court; but being urg'd to make a fuller Diſcovery and Confeſſion of the Plot, which he affirm'd he knew nothing of, he fell again into his Unkle's Diſpleaſure, and conſequently into his Father's, and ſo was Baniſhed from the Royal Preſence. Several others who were ſaid to be concerned in this Plot, fled beyond Seas, and were Out-lawed for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing here in Court; among whom was one <hi>Holloway</hi>
                     <pb n="635" facs="tcp:61951:438"/> a <hi>Briſtol-Merchant,</hi> who was taken at <hi>Nevis</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and brought over hither: He was wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſome of the Duke's Creatures to make a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he ſhould have his Pardon; and when he had own'd enough to Hang himſelf, he was offered the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a Tryal, which he refuſed, and flung himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's Mercy, and ſo was Executed. And not long after Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> Maſter of Horſe to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> (who upon the Proclamation put out for apprehending him) had fled into <hi>Holland,</hi> was taken out of <hi>Leyden</hi> by Surprize, and brought to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and it being Term-time, was ſoon after carried to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> where that infamous Wretch, Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> being at that time Lord Chief Juſtice, order'd him to be Executed the <hi>Friday</hi> following, he being already Out-lawed. But Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> boldly Demanded the benefit of the Law, which was on his ſide, for by a Statute of the 6th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. it was Enacted, <hi>That if any Perſon Out-law'd for Treaſon being beyond the Sea, ſhall within one Year after ſuch Out-lawry render himſelf to the chief Juſtice of</hi> England, <hi>he ſhould Reverſe his Out-lawry and take a Tryal;</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> then deſir'd, it being his Caſe. But the Cheif Juſtice over-rul'd it, and would not admit of his Plea, nor let him have Counſel to Argue it: But gave a Rule of Court for his Execution the <hi>Friday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; the Impudent Chief Juſtice charging <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in a Jeering manner, to ſee that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had the full benefit of the Law then: And accordingly he was drawn up on a Sledge to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there Executed, Denying his Knowledge of any Plot whatſoever againſt the King. But Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Death was Voted <hi>Murther</hi> by the Parliament ſince this happy Revolution. The pretence of this Plot gave them a ſpecious Ground to Perſecute the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the Goals throughout <hi>England,</hi> being at this time filled with them, and Multitudes Cited to, and Excommunicated by the Spiritual Courts, for <hi>Nonconformity;</hi> Executing upon them all the Vengeance that was poſſible: Some being puniſh'd as <hi>Rioters;</hi> ſome for <hi>Treaſonable Words,</hi> and ſome upon
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:61951:439"/> Actions of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> and Fined Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly, beyond all Law or Reaſon; of which laſt Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pilkington</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> were Severe inſtances, each being Fined 100000<hi>l.</hi> to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>But a little before this time, the Vertuous Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> youngeſt Daughter to the Duke, was Married to Prince <hi>George,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Brother; the Match being generally liked by the People, he being a Proteſtant Prince. And the <hi>Hamborough</hi> Company, in Gratitude for Favours receiv'd from the King in Relation to their Charter, erected his Statue of grey Marble, in the midſt of the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> in the Habit of a <hi>Roman Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the State of the Nation, when upon <hi>Monday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> 1684/5, the King was taken with an <hi>Apoplectick</hi> Fit, which if it carried him not out of the World then, 'tis certain it did the <hi>Friday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Dying in the 54th Year of his Age, having Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 36 Years, and ſome few Days.</p>
                  <p>He was a Prince that very much indulg'd himſelf in taking his Pleaſure; and was very unlike his Father in this, That he was a great Lover of Women, and kept variety of them, as the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleaveland, Nell Gwynn,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> the laſt of which was made uſe of by his Brother, to make the King do whatever he had a mind to have done; for ſo much was the King taken with her <hi>French</hi> Charms, that he could deny her nothing: And therefore advancing of Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, was done by her Mediation; and even Parliaments themſelves Prorogu'd or Diſſolv'd, if ſhe had a Mind to have it ſo: He was not a Prince Bloody or Cruel in his own Nature; yet by the Aſcendant his Brother had over him, many worthy Perſons loſt their Lives in his Reign. He was a Prince of very good Natural Parts, had they not been Vitiated by giving himſelf up ſo much to the ſatisfaction of his Luſts. His making War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and joyning with <hi>France</hi> againſt them, weaken'd the Proteſtant Intereſt, and has made the <hi>French</hi> ſo For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to <hi>Europe.</hi> And having carry'd on his Brother's Deſigns in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> as long as he thought Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:61951:439"/> he dyed of a ſudden; but whether Naturally, or by ſome Foul Play, I will not determine, tho' the latter was much Suſpected. However, the Nation had a real Kindneſs for him, and the News of his Death fill'd all Eyes with Tears, and all Hearts with Sadneſs, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe of the Papiſts, and ſome <hi>Tories</hi> that were worſe than they) But this proceeded chiefly from the Fears and diſmal Apprehenſions the People had of the enſuing Reign.</p>
                  <p>In the Eleventh Year of this Kings Reign, a Prodigious Whale came up to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and run it ſelf on ſhore there; ſoon after which <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (then <hi>Protector</hi>) died.</p>
                  <p>In his 17th Year 3 Blazing Stars appeared, of different ſhapes and colours, which were look'd on to be the Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiators of enſuing Judgements.</p>
                  <p>In his 18th Year, was a great Plague in <hi>London,</hi> of which died far more than ever did in any Plague before, and in the next Year the greateſt part of the City of <hi>London</hi> was Conſumed by Fire.</p>
                  <p>In the 33d Year of his Reign, on the 18th of <hi>May,</hi> 1680, a great ſtorm of <hi>Hail</hi> fell in <hi>London</hi> and the parts adjacent, the <hi>Hail-ſtones</hi> being of an extraordinary bigneſs, ſome of them nine inches about, and generally as big as <hi>Pullets Eggs,</hi> with the figures of Stars, and other curious works upon them, being alſo very hard: Several <hi>Rooks</hi> in the <hi>Temple-garden</hi> being kill'd by them; and many Sky-lights in <hi>London</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces by their violent failing upon them. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which a Prodigious <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> appeared in the <hi>Weſt</hi> for ſeveral Weeks together.</p>
                  <p>In the 37th Year of his Reign there was a great Froſt, that continued from the beginning of <hi>December</hi> to the end of <hi>February;</hi> in which time the <hi>Thames</hi> was frozen ſo hard, that Booths were erected upon the <hi>Ice;</hi> and all ſorts of Commodities ſold in them, inſomuch that it was called Blanket-Fair: Alſo a Bull was baited upon the <hi>Ice;</hi> and Coaches ply'd from the Temple ſtairs to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term.</p>

                  <head>The Reign of King <hi>JAMES</hi> the Second.</head>
                  <p>KING <hi>Charles</hi> the Second being Dead, on the ſame day in the afternoon, being <hi>February</hi> the 6th. 1684/5. his Brother <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was Proclaimed King. And upon his coming to the Council, He declared, that ſince it had pleaſed God to place him in that ſtation, to ſucced ſo good a King, as well as ſo kind a Brother, he thought it fit to declare his Endeavours to follow his Brothers Example, more eſpecially in that of his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to his People; and make it his Endavour to preſerve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in Church and State, as it is by Law Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: And then comends the Church of <hi>England's</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Members; telling them, He knows likewiſe that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient to make the King as Great a Monarch as he can wiſh: And therefore as he will never depart from the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo he will never invade any Mans Property.</p>
                  <p>This Speech of the Kings to his Council, was forthwith Printed and Publiſhed, and received every where with great Applauſe; many hoping their fears were greater than there was occaſion for. But how he kept to this Declariation, (which had he done, he might have been happy) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of his Reign will ſhew.</p>
                  <p>There was now no longer Occaſion for the King to Diſſemble what he was; and therefore what his Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> had acted in Maſquerade, King <hi>James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do bare-fac'd; and accordingly the next Sunday after his acceſſion to the Crown, he went publickly to Maſs; (which Convinc'd thoſe, that before would not believe him to be a Papiſt) and I have heard it Reported, That the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> carrying the Sword before him, reſign'd it at the Door; upon which the King told him, <hi>His Father would have gone further with him:</hi> To which the Duke ſmartly Reply'd <hi>But your Majeſties Father
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:61951:440"/> would not have gone ſo far:</hi> And ſo went to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Chappel. In a few days after, the King Publiſhed a Paper of his Brother's dying a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> and of his Receiving the extream Unction and other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>Roman-Church,</hi> before his Death, atteſted by one <hi>Huddleſton</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt: And alſo a Paper ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s his <hi>Strong-Box,</hi> ſhevving that hovvever he appear'd othervviſe outvvardly, yet in his heart he vvas a Sincere true <hi>Roman-Catholick.</hi> The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Exciſe dying vvith King <hi>Charles,</hi> being granted only for his Life, the King puts out a Proclamation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the paying of them till they ſhould be granted by Parliament. Which vvas his firſt <hi>Specimen</hi> hovv vvell he intended to preſerve Mens Properties, vvhen his very firſt Publick Act of Government, vvas a Notorious violation both of Mens Properties, and of the Lavvs of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, his Brother (King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) vvas Buried, but vvith ſo little Pomp and Solemnity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Majeſty of a King, that he vvas as it vvere throvvn into his Grave in the dead time of the Night, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by fevv Perſons; as if his Corps had been in danger of being Arreſted for Debt: He was interred indeed in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's Chappel, but without any Stone to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him: So that never any King that died poſſeſt of a Throne, was ſo meanly Buried. Yet was it well enough for King <hi>Charles,</hi> whoſe latter part of his Reign was as Dark as his Burial was Obſcure. But this notes the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the King to ſo kind a Brother as he had always been to him.</p>
                  <p>A little before King <hi>Charles</hi> died, Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> was fined 100000<hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and to be kept a cloſe Priſoner till the Fine was paid; which mighty Scandal was, for ſaying, <hi>The Duke was reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome: Which now the King acknowledged. But this muſt not ſerve <hi>Oats</hi>'s turn; a Fine and Impriſonment was no ſufficient Compenſation for the Lives of the <hi>Popiſh Martyrs</hi> that ſuffered in his Brother's Reign; and therefore the King having him now within his Clutches, an Indictment for <hi>Perjury</hi> is preferr'd againſt
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:61951:441"/> 
                     <hi>Oats;</hi> and the Perjury aſſign'd is Double; firſt, That <hi>Ireland</hi> (one of the Executed <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) was not in <hi>London</hi> from the third of <hi>August,</hi> 1678, till the 14th of <hi>Sept.</hi> next following; whereas <hi>Oats</hi> at the ſaid <hi>Ireland's</hi> Tryal, Swore, That he was at a Conſult about killing the King in the middle of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Secondly, That <hi>Oats</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> 1678: Whereas at the Tryal of <hi>Harcourt</hi> and <hi>White-bread,</hi> &amp;c. he Swore they were at a Conſult the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> concerning killing the King, and eſtabliſhing the <hi>Popiſh Religion. Ireland</hi> at his Tryal, which was in 1678, urged the firſt Point, and <hi>Harcourt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. at their Tryals in 1679, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecond; but <hi>Oats</hi> prov'd both ſo inconteſtably at their ſeveral Tryals, that it was both to the Satisfaction of Judge and Jury, and of the whole Nation. But now the Caſe was alter'd, the Deſign was to invalidate the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and to puniſh <hi>Oats</hi> for juſtifying it. And they were pretty ſure to carry it, having ſuch a Jury as would be ſure to find him Guilty upon any Evidence, and againſt the moſt Subſtantial Evidence to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that Mirror of Injuſtice, <hi>Jefferies</hi> being <hi>Judge.</hi> The Witneſſes againſt him were the St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s Youths, now better inſtructed than they were before, who all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred their Leſſon to a T. and ſwore <hi>Oats</hi> was at St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> and the Popiſh <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> Witneſſes (at that Tryal counted as good Witneſſes as any in the World) Swore <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> or thereabouts, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September.</hi> As to this laſt, I find a Paſſage in <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>Detection of the four laſt Reigns,</hi> that juſtifies <hi>Oats</hi>'s Evidence beyond all Peradventure, which I will here Inſert, and leave to Poſterity to judge of: It is briefly this;</p>

I am aſſured Mr</hi> Hinton <hi>was in Court at</hi> Oats<hi>'s Tryal, to have teſtified this, but was terrified from it, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how true ſoever <hi>Oats</hi>'s Teſtimony was, he was found guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi> upon both Points, before <hi>Jefferies</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, and had Sentence to be Whipt from <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Newgate</hi> on the <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and on the <hi>Friday</hi> from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> which was ſo ſeverely Executed, that he received at his two Whippings 13000 Stripes; beſides which he was to ſtand in the Pillory five times in the Year, and to be a Priſoner during Life. And ſoon after Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was Sentenc'd to undergo the like Puniſhment; (which yet had a more Fatal Iſſue) for diſcovering the <hi>Meal-Tub-Plot,</hi> of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign. For <hi>Dangerfield</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back from his laſt Whipping, was run into the Eye by one <hi>Francis,</hi> which touching his Brain, he dy'd of the Wound in a few Hours: For which <hi>Francis</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hang'd.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the King's coming to the Crown, care was taken to provide a Parliament fit for the King's purpoſe (to which way had been made the latter end of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Reign, by <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s againſt Corporations, and by the ſurrender of <hi>Charters</hi>) and they met the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>May:</hi> Where the King made the ſame Speech to them for Subſtance, which he did at firſt to his Privy Council; adding, That he expected they ſhould ſettle his
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:61951:442"/> Revenue during his Life, which he muſt not ſuffer to be Precarious. And the Parliament anſwer'd his Ends, ſettling the Exciſe and Cuſtoms upon him during his Life, (which indeed he took before, without their giving him) and gave him other Moneys beſide.</p>
                  <p>During the ſitting of the Parliament, on the 11th of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> arrived at <hi>Lime,</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-ſhire,</hi> with three Ships, whereof one was a Man of War of 32 Guns, and about 80 Men; and having Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken poſſeſſion of the Town without any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he Publiſhed a <hi>Declaration,</hi> wherein he Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he came over to reſtore the Kingdom to it's Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rights and Priviledges, which were all invaded by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his Adherents, the Inſtruments of his Tyranny, charging him with the Murder of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and of the late King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And inviting the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons, to come in to him, and to aſſiſt him for the recovery of their loſt Liberties, and bringing the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to ſpeedy Juſtice. Tho' at the Duke's Landing his Complement wanted of an Hundred, yet upon Notice of his being Landed, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreas'd, ſo that in a few Days he was ſeveral Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſtrong; ſo that leaving <hi>Lime</hi> he went to <hi>Taunton,</hi> encreaſing ſtill as he went. King <hi>James</hi> in the mean time having his Parliament by him, firſt puts out a Proclamation for apprehending of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and offers 5000<hi>l.</hi> as a Reward for any that ſhould take him; and the Parliament to ſhew their Loyalty ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e an Act at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainting him of High-Treaſon: And beſides this, the King ſent ſeveral of his Forces down againſt him, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Feverſham.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermarle</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> had rais'd the Militia of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the King, and brought his Forces within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Mile of the <hi>Duke,</hi> who prepar'd to Fight him: But the Duke of <hi>Albermarle</hi> perceiving that his Forces were inclin'd rather to Fight for <hi>Monmouth</hi> than againſt him; withdrew with ſ me Precipitation, without doing any thing, being fearful of being purſu'd by <hi>Monmouth;</hi> which if <hi>Monmouth</hi> had done, he had certainly put him
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:61951:442"/> to the Rout, and taken all his Arms, which was the only thing that <hi>Monmouth</hi> wanted. The King's Forces were now come into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and at <hi>Phillip's-Norton</hi> met with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> between whom and the King's Forces there was a brisk Rencounter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King's Forces retreated with Loſs, <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Men firing fiercely upon them. Soon after the Duke marched to <hi>Canſham-bridge,</hi> intending to go for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but hearing the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was with a Body of Men to oppoſe him in his way, he turn'd about and went to <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> whither the King's Forces followed him; and lay at a place called <hi>Sedge-moor;</hi> there in the dead time of the Night, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> the Duke with a Guide Marches againſt the King's Forces, with 3000 Foot and 1000 Horſe; and falling upon them, a very fierce Fight enſued, the Duke's Foot fighting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable well, but his Horſe hardly ever came up; and his Foot having ſpent all their Ammunition, and being put in Diſorder by the King's Horſe, in the end were put to the Rout; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> himſelf, with the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and ſome others, making their Eſcape, and riding towards the Borders of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> where on the 8th of <hi>July</hi> the Duke was taken, as alſo the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and a Noble <hi>Brandenburger</hi> that came over with him. They were all brought to <hi>London</hi> with a ſtrong Guard, on the 13th, and the D. after having been Examined at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> was Committed to the Tower, and being already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by Parliament, a Warrant was ſigned by the King for his Execution, and on the 15th of <hi>July</hi> he was Beheaded on Tower-hill, many pittying of him, but none being able to help him. But this was one Specimen more of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Love to ſo good and kind a Brother as K. <hi>Charles</hi> the II. had been to him, cutting off the Head of his beloved Son.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke's Defeat at <hi>Sedgmoor,</hi> many of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were taken and put in Priſon; and then the Chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferies</hi> was ſent down to keep the Aſſizes there, where he acted ſo many barbarous things, that 'tis a ſhame to Name them, and Poſterity will ſcarce believe them: For in the Counties of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet,</hi>
                     <pb n="644" facs="tcp:61951:443"/> above three Hundred Perſons were Executed, and their Heads and Quarters were ſet upon Poles, and placed both in all the chief Towns, and in the Roads and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for many Miles together, both to the Terror and Annoyance of Travellers as they paſt along. And thus it is that King <hi>James</hi> performs his Word to his Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, at his firſt coming to the Crown, of his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow the Example of his dear Brother in all things, eſpecially in that of his great Tenderneſs and Clemency to his People.</p>
                  <p>But it is not all the Blood ſhed in the <hi>Weſt</hi> that will Suffice; there are ſtill other Victims to be offer'd up; for upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> 1685. Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> was taken off of the Exchange, (where he was following his Buſineſs without any apprehenſion of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards him, thinking his own Innocency a ſufficient Defence) and committed cloſe Priſoner to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and on the <hi>Saturday</hi> night following had Notice to prepare for his Tryal on <hi>Monday,</hi> at which time he was Tryed for High-Treaſon, in promiſing to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> &amp;c. againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in the Year 1682. The chief Witneſs againſt him was <hi>Rumſey,</hi> who Swore, That the Declaration for a Riſing being read, Alderman <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> being preſent, and being ask'd how he lik'd it, he anſwer'd, <hi>Very well; and what poor Intereſt he had, he would join in it.</hi> And yet this Fellow at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Tryal, Swore <hi>Corniſh</hi> was not there when the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was read, nor knew nothing of it. However, the Alderman's Death was reſolved on, and both Judge and Jury being agreed, he was found Guilty, Condemn'd, and on the 23th of the ſame Month executed in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> over againſt the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of the City, Declaring his Innocency as to what he was Condemn'd for, to the very laſt: And indeed Heaven it ſelf atteſted it for him, for his Execution was follow'd with ſuch a dreadful Storm of Wind, attended with Thunder, Lightning, and Rain, as the like has ſcarce happened at that time of the Year, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man. His true Crime was, That he was a Zealous
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:61951:443"/> Proteſtant, that had ſerv'd the City Faithfully in his Shrievalty, and had Examined <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and had like to have diſcovered the Depth of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Deſign againſt the Proteſtants. The ſame Day alſo one Mrs. <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a Woman of great Goodneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was burn'd at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> for relieving a Lieutenant under <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> himſelf being the Witneſs againſt her, for which he had his Pardon.</p>
                  <p>And now the Parliament met again, and the King tells them how he had Defeated <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that ſeveral <hi>Popiſh Officers</hi> had been very uſeful to him therein; that he could not be without their Service; and that the Militia was not ſufficient, without keeping up a ſtanding Army; and hopes they will help him to Defray the Charge; but the Parliament addreſs to him to Disband his Popiſh Officers, and offers to paſs an Act to Indempnify them from the Penalties they had already incurr'd in ſerving without having taken the Teſt appointed by Law: This Addreſs of the Commons was very ſurpriſing to the King, who expected from them abſolute Obedience without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: But the King was much more Surpriz'd when he underſtood that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> had made a motion in the Houſe of Lords to take the King's Speech into Conſideration, as fearing the Lords would concur with the Commons in their Addreſs. But the King was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to prevent it, and therefore firſt Prorogued, and ſoon after Diſſolved the Parliament; who had been ſo large in their Supplies the firſt Seſſion, that now (too late) they ſaw he was able to live without them.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament's queſtioning of the Popiſh Officers, had put them all into a Fright, but the Parliament being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, they were all at eaſe again, and nothing but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Officers, and Prieſts and Jeſuites are ſeen about the Court; who were grown to an unparallell'd degree of Impudence. And yet to find Fault with them, was a Crime next to High-Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>But the King finding the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> ſtand as a mighty Obſtacle in his way, was reſolv'd to remove them: In order to which, the Lord-Keeper <hi>North</hi> dying,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:61951:444"/> while <hi>Jefferies</hi> was keeping the Bloody Aſſizes in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> at his return back, he had the <hi>Seals</hi> given him, with the Title of <hi>Lord-Chancellor,</hi> as a Reward for his good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in deſtroying the <hi>Weſtern Hereticks;</hi> and as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to him to deſtroy the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> the great Bulwark againſt Popery. And therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power in the King, is that which muſt next be ſet up in order to effect it. And the Judges muſt be dealt with, to give their Opinions for it. And I have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly told, That the King Cloſetting Sir <hi>Thomas Jones</hi> about it, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was not enough thorow paced, but boggled at it, and told the King He could not do it: to which the King anſwering, <hi>He would have twelve Judges of his Opinion.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Replyed, <hi>He might have twelve Judges of his Opinion, but he would ſcarce find twelve Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of his Opinion.</hi> But the King was as good as his Word, and made ſuch Judges as gave their Opinions, That the King might diſpenſe with the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> out of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> having always look'd upon the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> with an evil Eye, did ſo now more than ever, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving writ ſeveral Elaborate and Learned Books, in oppoſition to the principal Errors of Popery, which they were never able to anſwer: But they were reſolv'd if they could not deal with them one way, they would another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King granted a Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, expreſly contrary to Law, thereby to Curb them. This Commiſſion was Granted to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Chancellor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the Lord-Chief-Juſtice of <hi>England:</hi> But the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> refuſing to act in it, the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was added: Before theſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was Cited, and Suſpended, for not Suſpending Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> for Preaching a Sermon againſt the Corruptions and Frauds of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> the King having recalled the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> from his Lieutenancy, made the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:61951:444"/> and Sir <hi>Charles Porter</hi> Lord-Chancellor, who after their arrival there, declared (according to their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that the King would preſerve the Acts of Settlement and Explanation, inviolable, as the <hi>Magna-Charta</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But at the ſame time the King having given to Collonel <hi>Richard Talbot</hi> (a Man not at all belov'd by the Proteſtants) an Independent Commiſſion to reform the Army, and he turns out thoſe Officers that were firm to the Proteſtant Religion and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and puts Notorious <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts in their Room, and ſerves not only the Officers, but even the private Troopers and Soldiers that were Proteſtants, in the ſame manner. So that one of the beſt principled Armies in the World, both with reſpect to Loyalty, and a firm adherence to the Proteſtant Religion, was turn'd out and Disbanded, and a parcel of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Cut-Throats entertain'd in their places; which ſeemed ſtrange to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants there, and not at all agreeable to what my Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Porter</hi> had told them; who were not themſelves pleaſed with it, but knew not how to help it.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>England</hi> the King having eſtabliſhed his Diſpenſing Power, puts forth a Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience; purſuant to which, the Goals all over <hi>England,</hi> that were fill'd with Proteſtant Diſſenters, were clear'd, and the Diſſenters ſet at Liberty: Who having been long oppreſs'd and almoſt ruin'd by ſevere Proſecutions for ſeveral Years together, were now glad of a little Eaſe; tho' the moſt Judicious among them ſaw clearly enough it was not for their Sakes, but to introduce Popery, that this Indulgence was principally Granted; and therefore were always afraid of the Snake hid in the Graſs. The Epiſcopal Clergy, who in the late Reign, and the beginning of this alſo, had been very ſevere to Diſſenters, began now to ſee they had been only Tools in ſo doing to the Papiſts, and had carried on their W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="648" facs="tcp:61951:445"/> was their time to call them to an Account, and be even with them for it; and ſeveral of the Diſſenters (who were very Honeſt, tho' miſtaken Men) were by theſe ſpecious Pretences drawn in to joyn with them.</p>
                  <p>The King was ſo fond or his Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, that he Publiſhes it a ſecond time, with an Injunction to have it read in all Pariſh-Churches; and the Biſhops of the reſpective Dioceſſes were to ſee it done. But the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſeveral of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, looking upon this as a thing contrary to Law, not only refuſed to do it, but humbly Petitioned the King to hear the Reaſons why they could not comply with that Order. But this was looked upon by <hi>Jefferies,</hi> then Lord-Chancellor, Father <hi>Peters,</hi> (then made one of the Privy-Council) and others of the Popiſh Faction, as a Crime next to High-Treaſon; and therefore for their Contempt they were Committed to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>It was now more than a Year that had paſſed ſince the King's Declaration for Indulgence came forth; and the Prince and Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This it was that touch'd the Papiſts to the quick, for they ſaw that the King was well ſtricken in Years, and upon his Death (which they knew not how ſoon might happen) a Proteſtant Princeſs was the next Heir, who would ſoon pull down all that <hi>Babel,</hi> which they had been Building; and therefore ſome other Proviſion muſt be made for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popiſh Succeſſor.</p>
                  <p>And nothing could do this ſo well as a young Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> during whoſe Minority (if the Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And all things were carried on by the Faction in order to it's Birth.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> being not very well, was advis'd by her Phyſicians to go down to the <hi>Bath,</hi> for the Recovery of her Health.

                  <p>The King was now buſie in modelling all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in <hi>England</hi> that ſend <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> to <hi>Parliament,</hi> to get a <hi>Parliament</hi> fitted to his own Turn, in order to take off the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> no other obſtacle now lying in his way; when on a ſudden he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with the News of the great Preparations ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> both by Sea and Land: Upon which account, the King ſends to his Envoy at the <hi>Hague</hi> to put in a Memorial to the <hi>States General</hi> to know the Reaſon. The <hi>French</hi> King alſo, who was concern'd at it, orders his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> there to deliver in a Memorial upon that occaſion, wherein he tells the States, There are ſuch Bonds of Friendſhip and Alliance between his Maſter and the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> as will oblige him (the <hi>French</hi> King) not only to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> but to look on the firſt Act of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity committed againſt him (the King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi>) to be a Manifeſt Rupture of the Peace, and a Breach with his Crown. This left no longer any doubt in the mind of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the States General, of the private League between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Which was a ſufficient Ground for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to reſcue theſe Kingdoms (to which (in Right of his Princeſs) he was the next Heir) from Popery and Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For he ſaw plainly that the Suppoſititions Prince was Introduc'd to wrong him and his Princeſs of their Right to the Succeſſion, and to ſubject theſe Kingdoms to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and by conſequence all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides. The <hi>Dutch</hi> took no notice of the <hi>French</hi> King's Memorial, but gave King <hi>James</hi>'s Envoy this Anſwer, that they had Arm'd in Imitation of his <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty, and the other Princes; and that they had thereby given no juſt occaſion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in Arming when all other Princes where in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that they were long ſince convinced of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance that the King his Maſter had treated with <hi>France,</hi> and what had been mention'd to them by Monſier <hi>de Count d' Avaux</hi> in his Memorial.

<pb n="652" facs="tcp:61951:447"/> King <hi>James</hi> expected no good from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and lookt upon them, as if they had already declar'd War againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And now the Eyes of all <hi>England</hi> were turned to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and expected Deliverance from thence; without which they ſaw themſelves Ruined; nor did his Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> deceive them, but Landed with an Army of about 14000 Men, at <hi>Torbay</hi> near <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter,</hi> on the Fifth day of <hi>November,</hi> 1688. A day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly Famous in <hi>England</hi> for two eminent Deliverances from <hi>Popery.</hi> Soon after his Landing he went to <hi>Exceter,</hi> where he was received by the People with Shouts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Joy as their Deliverer, as indeed he was: After ſome little ſtay there, he came forwards towards the <hi>South;</hi> but King <hi>James</hi> to oppoſe him, ſent down his Army to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whither he alſo went himſelf; but part of the Army going over to the <hi>Prince,</hi> the King was ſo Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the mean time King <hi>James</hi> to prevent (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) the impending and growing danger, Reſtores all the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi> and puts out his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vacating all New <hi>Charters,</hi> and reſtoring of old ones, and Particularly the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great Pomp to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> by <hi>Jefferies,</hi> and given the Citizens again. But for all theſe good things there was no body now thank'd him, as being the Effects of his Fear, and not of his good will. The Prince's coming nearer and nearer to <hi>London,</hi> the Nobility and Gentry at every Place Flocking to him, and Congratulating him; King <hi>James</hi> firſt ſends away his <hi>Queen</hi> and pretended <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> and in a little time after withdraws himſelf from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and goes to <hi>Feverſham,</hi> where attempting to go a-board, he was ſeiezed and rifled by the Country People, and after his being known, he came back to <hi>London</hi> again, and was well receiv'd; but the <hi>Prince</hi> being then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and deſigning the next

                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> being thus gone away, upon the Prince's coming to <hi>London,</hi> he was deſir'd by the Nobility and Gentry to take the Government upon him, thereby to ſuppreſs the Diſorders of the common People, which was then very Great; but by the Prince's Order ſoon brought to be quiet. The <hi>Maſs-Houſes</hi> were every vvhere pull'd down, and the Prieſts and Jeſuits, with the whole Popiſh Crew, put to the Scamper. <hi>Jefferies</hi> being dropt by his Maſter, was ſhifting for himſelf, but taken by the Mobb in a Seaman's Habit, was carried before the Lord-Mayor, and from thence ſent to the Tower, attended by ſtrong Guards to keep him from being torn in Pieces by the incenſed Mobb, who follow'd him with Threats, Curſes, and Execrations; where ſometime after he drank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Death, and ſo ſav'd the Hang-man a Labour.</p>

And the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> at this time aſſiſted the King with 6000 <hi>Daniſh</hi> Soldiers, under the Leading of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> who did notable Service. <hi>Charlemont</hi> having been ſtraightly Blocked up, Capitulated; and other places were Reduced by Force.</p>

                  <p>And now the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> waited on the King with their humble Addreſſes of Thanks for the great Things he had done for theſe Kingdoms, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his happy Return and Succeſs; and the King was not ſlow by Marks of Honour and Promotion, to Gratify thoſe that had well-behaved themſelves in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and among others, Coll. <hi>Cuts</hi> was Created Baron of <hi>Gowran</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> he alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Privy Council there, and all other Officers of State, Judges, and Magiſtrates; reſtored ſuch as had been outed, and appointed ſome new Biſhops, cauſing a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Clergy in General.</p>

                  <p>Tho' the French on theſe Occaſions boaſted of ſome Succeſs by Land, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Forces, ſince the laſt Overthrow, were but ſlenderly Recruited; and Admiral Ruſſel having notice by a Swede there was a great Fleet in Conquet-Bay, Laden with Corn, and Naval Stores, ſent Capt.

Being in thoſe parts they brought a Terror on Argeirs, and other Pyratical Governments, ſo that they ſent their Submiſſions, and appeared very deſirous to be at Peace with England. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a ſufficient Squadron being left in the narrow Seas, Commanded by the Lord Berkly, he attempted the French Coaſt, and Landed ſome Men at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret-Bay, under Lieutenant-General Talmaſh, but they had drawn thither ſuch great Bodies of Horſe and Foot ſtrongly Intrenched, that the Engliſh with ſome Loſs were conſtrained to retire; in this Action the Lieutenant-General received a Wound in the Thigh with a Musket-ſhot, and Dyed of it at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth greatly Lamented, as being an expert and Generous Commander. But for this Diſappointment not giving over, they ſtood in before Diep, and laid that Famous Town in Aſhes, and then throwing in about 250 Bombs into Havre-de-Grace, fir'd a great part of it, and afterward Bombed St. Maloes, and Callis, and ſent in Machines to blow up the Works, guarding the Entrance of Dunkirk Harbour: which had ſome, tho' not the wiſhed Effect: And ſo Sailing along the Coaſt of France, brought ſuch a Terror every where, that they were forced Night and Day to be on their Guard.</p>

Then they had other Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it, and appointed to be in a Readineſs the Saturday following, and met accordingly, and were ſetting out, when again they had Notice the ſame hand of Providence had Diſappointed them. This ſtartled them into new Fears that their wicked Deſign had taken Air, eſpecially upon notice the King's going abroad was ſuddenly put off, and the Guards were come back in haſte, their Horſes Foaming, and Keys, one of the Conſpirators heard them Mutter ſomething which gave him and the reſt a Jealouſy to miſtruſt a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was made, as indeed Providence had Ordered it; whereupon they Diſperſed and gave over the Deſign. For Capt. Pendergraſs being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this bloody Deſign from Capt. Porter, about the 13th of February, at the Plew-Poſts in Spring-Garden, and ſtruck with Horrour at ſo Stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Wickedneſs, acquainted the Earl of Portland with it, intreating him to Diſcover it to the King, which he did; and Pendergraſs was thereupon intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him to the King in his Cloſet, where he opened the nature of the Conſpiracy, with the Circumſtances, but was a long time preſſed to it before he would name the Conſpirators, which at laſt he did, under Promiſe he ſhould not be brought in for a Witneſs, unleſs he would voluntarily do it. This was ſeconded and confirmed by Monſieur De la Rue, who was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the King by Brigadier Lewſon, who gave in the Names of thoſe he knew: And much about the ſame time came Expreſſes from the Duke of Wirtemburg, that the French Forces to the number of 22000, were drawn down to Callis, Dunkirk, and other Sea-ports, where there lay about 500 Tranſport-ſhips, and a great many Men of War to conduct them for their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in England with the firſt fair Wind, with the late K.
